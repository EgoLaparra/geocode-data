He founded a new town located on some forested dunes in the middle of a marsh. At age 26, he granted 's-Hertogenbosch city rights and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is, however, the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is 1196. The original charter has been lost. His reason for founding the city was to protect his own interests against encroachment from Gelre and Holland; from its first days, he conceived of the city as a fortress. It was destroyed in 1203 in a joint expedition of Gelre and Holland, but was soon rebuilt. Some remnants of the original city walls may still be seen. In the late 14th century, a much larger wall was erected to protect the greatly expanded settled area.

The red brick Federal townhouse was built in 1832 as an investment by Charles Starr (bookbinder) and includes some Greek Revival details. It was heightened two stories in 1872.[1] The structure is noteworthy for its elaborated round-arched brownstone doorcase, or "enframement of the front door," which has an exceptional treatment of painted timber Ionic half-column sidelights, unique and highly significant in New York City architecture. Due to the sidelights, "instead of leaded glass, typical of the time, each sidelight is divided into three superimposed oval sections. The ovals are formed by a richly carved wood enframement that simulates a cloth sash curtain drawn through a series of rings."[2]

It is owned by Mitsui Fudosan. The structure is built in the international style[2] and looks like a simple cuboid devoid of any ornamentation. The vertical façade consists of alternating narrow glass and limestone stripes. The glass stripes are created by windows and opaque spandrels, forming continuous areas that are washed by machines sliding down the façade. A seven-floor base wraps around the western portion of the building, and there is a sunken plaza with a large two-tier pool and fountains facing Sixth Avenue. In the plaza stands the bronze statue named Out to Lunch[3] by John Seward Johnson II—of the same series as the one standing outside the <link wikipedia="270_Park_Avenue" osm="146278002" type="way">270 Park Avenue</link>.[4]

The battery was the only armed unit in Finnish Army made up from women that was organized as a military unit fit for combat duty. The searchlight battery was operational from late summer 1944 to the end of the Continuation War but did not see action.[1]

      <p id="GL001_152_002" num_links="4">As the air-defences of Helsinki were improved in spring 1944 after the winter bombings it was decided to replace some of the personnel in searchlight units with women to ease manpower shortage. Three hundred women were selected from students working already in air surveillance duties, of whom 215 arrived for searchlight training. The trainees were mainly from Helsinki University of Technology, <link wikipedia="University_of_Helsinki" osm="446178813 1320784" type="way relation">University of Helsinki</link> and Ateneum, but also from schools in <link wikipedia="Turku" osm="21847490 399906" type="node relation">Turku</link> and <link wikipedia="Tampere" osm="30969480 3579531" type="node relation">Tampere</link>. The training began on 31 May 1944 in <link wikipedia="Laajasalo" osm="188819" type="relation">Laajasalo</link> in Helsinki, but was suspended already on 9 June since there was no guarantee that the women would continue to serve after fall (student work responsibility only covered summer months). The training continued after the women expressed interest in the task and pledged to serve for as long as the war demanded or a minimum of one year. After this the number of trainees was set at 145 and the training was concentrated to Anti-aircraft regiment 1 (Finnish: Ilmatorjuntarykmentti 1 (ItR 1)) in Helsinki, while the training in 1st Independent Anti-aircraft Battalion (Finnish: 1. Erillinen ilmatorjuntapatteristo (1.Er.ItPsto)) in Turku and 2nd Independent Anti-aircraft Battalion (Finnish: 2. Erillinen ilmatorjuntapatteristo (2.Er.ItPsto)) in Tampere was discontinued. Captain K. H. Pentti led the training while Inkeri Simola acted as the Lotta leader. Simola was later succeeded by Aino Airamo. A voluntary written commitment to remain in service as well as passing a medical examination for continuous outdoor duty was required from the women who wished to serve in the searchlight battery.[1][2]

This outbreak, which killed 616 people, is best known for the physician John Snow's study of its causes and his hypothesis that germ-contaminated water was the source of cholera, rather than particles in the air (referred to as "miasmata").[1][2] This discovery came to influence public health and the construction of improved sanitation facilities beginning in the mid-19th century. Later, the term "focus of infection" started to be used to describe sites, such as the Broad Street pump, in which conditions are good for transmission of an infection. Snow's endeavour to find the cause of the transmission of cholera caused him to unknowingly create a double-blind experiment.

The next day, the massacre was defended by a group calling itself Alianza Apostólica Anticomunista (literally Apostolic Anticommunist Alliance, abbreviated Triple A or AAA). The suspects arrested were close to Blas Piñar's Fuerza Nueva far-right party, the Falange-JONS and the Franco Guard. The indignation brought about by the killings accelerated the legalisation of the Communist party, which took place in Easter 1977. On March 24, 1984, the Italian daily Il Messaggero stated that, possibly, Italian neo-fascists had taken part in the shootings, pointing toward some kind of "Black International".[1] This allegation was confirmed by a report from the Italian CESIS, which confirmed that Carlo Cicuttini, who was also involved in the Peteano massacre, took part in the Atocha massacre.[2]

The landslide was focused around turbine 68 in the Derrybrien wind farm, and disrupted further construction. It dislodged 450,000 cubic metres of peat[1] after days of dry weather. While initially coming to rest 2.5 km away, it moved further three weeks later when rains came, entering the "Derrywee River" or Abhainn Da Loilioch,[2] and eventually spilled 20 km away into "Lough Cutra".[3] The lake was also the source of the townland of <link wikipedia="Gort" osm="52219822 5149803" type="node relation">Gort</link>'s drinking water, and this caused disruptions to supply.[2] An impact assessment on the wildlife within the lake determined that more than 50 per cent of fish in the lake had been killed due to this pollution, about 50,000 fish of all ages and species groups had perished. A smaller peat slide near turbine 17 had occurred prior to the main movement on the 16th but it did not result in the suspension of the construction of the wind turbine farm.[3]

With a total length of 2,277 metres (7,470 ft), it is the 38th largest suspension bridge in the world. The upper deck carries six car lanes, while the lower deck carries a double track railway electrified at 25 kV AC; the train platform was added in 1999.  From 1966–1974, the bridge was named Salazar Bridge (Ponte Salazar) in honor of Portuguese Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar, who ordered its construction.  After the Carnation Revolution which overthrew the remnants of Salazar's dictatorship, the bridge was renamed for April 25, the date of the revolution. It is also sometimes called the Tagus River Bridge or in Portuguese Ponte sobre o Tejo ("bridge over the Tagus").[1][2]

      <p id="GL001_338_002" num_links="3">From the late 19th century, there had been proposals to build a bridge for Lisbon. In 1929, the idea advanced as a Portuguese engineer and entrepreneur, António Bello requested a Government concession for a railway crossing between Lisbon and <link wikipedia="Montijo,_Portugal" osm="5401737" type="relation">Montijo</link> (where the <link wikipedia="Vasco_da_Gama_Bridge" osm="4247904" type="way">Vasco da Gama Bridge</link>, the second bridge serving Lisbon, was later built in 1998). As a result, the Minister of Public Works, Duarte Pacheco, created a commission in 1933 to analyse the request. The commission reported in 1934, and proposed building a road and rail bridge. Bids were obtained. However, this proposal was subsequently put aside in favour of a bridge crossing the river at <link wikipedia="Vila_Franca_de_Xira" osm="5400846" type="relation">Vila Franca de Xira</link>, 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of Lisbon.

The construction of this building was proposed in 2003, though, it was never approved by the state of Maryland. In 2006, the construction of the building was again proposed, and finally approved by the state of Maryland.[2] The building is being built where the Hearst Production Building once stood.[3] Plans are now scaled back to 40 stories and 300,000 square feet of office space, in addition to a 270-room hotel.[4] 300 East Pratt Street is located in Baltimore, MD between Commerce and South streets, housed the former Baltimore News-American building.
