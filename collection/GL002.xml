It was built in the Italianate style c.1844, and had its cast-iron facade, attributed to James Bogardus, added in 1857-59, making it one of the first cast-iron buildings in the city.  The attribution to Bogardus, a pioneer in the architectural use of cast iron, comes because of medallions of Benjamin Franklin identical to those on four other Bogardus projects, all now demolished. George Washington was also once represented with medallions.[1][2]

      <p id="GL002_059_002" num_links="3">During the early years of New York City, the current site to Riverside Park was largely undeveloped, consisting of rocky outcroppings and steep bluffs along the Hudson River shoreline.  Prior to European arrival, American Indians sparsely populated this rough terrain.[2]  In 1846 the Hudson River Railroad laid tracks across the Hudson River shoreline to speed the transport of goods from <link wikipedia="Albany,_New_York" osm="316976705 175549" type="node relation">Albany</link> to <link wikipedia="Manhattan" osm="357644127 2552485 8398124" type="node relation relation">Manhattan</link>.  In 1865, William R. Martin, a commissioner on the Board of Central Park proposed a scenic drive and park along the Hudson River. During the next two years New York City acquired land between the Hudson River Railroad and the bluffs along the shoreline, and in 1873 the New York City Park Board commissioned Riverside Park. The co-designer of <link wikipedia="Central_Park" osm="357719603 427818536" type="node way">Central Park</link>, Frederick Law Olmsted, was named lead designer. His design, which was accepted in 1875, included a winding drive for horses and sight-seeing, as well as pedestrian walkways, both accessible from the neighborhoods to the east.[3]

The building has a tile roof and parapets topping arcades on its sides, which suggest a Mission Revival influence; however, the battlement and the curves in the parapet are Moorish Revival elements. In addition, elements of the arches in the arcade, the windows, and the roof ridge were borrowed from classical, Gothic, Spanish Romanesque, and Oriental themens.

Improvements included an extra room of music being added to the two already in use (resulting in a lowered ceiling of the main room).[1] Along with the club's name change, the 3 spaces inside were named the Oxygen Arena, the Nitrogen Room and the Carbon Lounge.[3] The club features state-of-the-art lighting and sound systems. In 2002, Fergie (a resident DJ at the club for Godskitchen and Polysexual events in the early 2000s[4]) said "It is one of the best [sound] systems I've ever played on, throughout the whole world".[5]

Dorothy Garrod suggested similarities existed to a final Acheulean (or Yarbrudian) industry of Tabun E. Along with Diana Kirkbride, she re-opened excavations in 1958 with another season in 1963 and found a pre-Aurignacian (Garrod's Amudian) blade industry in the deposits.[3][4] D. A. Hooijer discussed the fauna of the site suggesting it included game animals and rhino.[5] Materials from the site are now in collections of the Saint Joseph University, <link wikipedia="Beirut" osm="289346590 5466662" type="node relation">Beirut</link> and the <link wikipedia="Museum_of_Archaeology_and_Anthropology,_University_of_Cambridge" osm="497841913" type="node">Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge</link>, <link wikipedia="Cambridge" osm="20971094 295355" type="node relation">Cambridge</link>.

Its relation with Brabant has been preserved in the city's white and red coat of arms, the colours of Lotharingia.
