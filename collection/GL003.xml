Ab Band is divided into two parts, North and South Aband. Between the two is a desert and a river which flows to the south into a lake. Much of Ab Band villages are now under Taliban control; only the district headquarters is under government control. Ab Band has no construction projects; its local people regularly go to Pakistan and Iran for work. There are four famous ethnic groups settled in Ab Band: Buden Khail, Na Khail, Mul Khail and Sorkhail. Ab Band is popular for its tasty grapes and resins that are usually exported to Ghazni city and Muqur district for trade and  exchange for goods. There is also a small bazaar (town) for locals to purchase daily needs and meet neighbor villagers. The bazaar is between Bazi and Chawnai villages.
Ab Band people are really poor; they struggle and work at agriculture fields for over 6 months to afford only the harsh winter. The water sources are Kariz's (a trench 4–5 km long underground at the starting point it might be 35 m deep, but the end water reaches to the surface and flows like  mesh). During the 2000s drought most of them become dried and people rushed for water pump drills. However, there is another problem villagers are disagree with water pumps because they will dry the rest of the Kariz's in the region. 
There is no main road specially, in the south during the winter about 2 or half months access to the area blocks by snow, people only go by foot.

The main draw for medieval pilgrims at Conques were the remains of Sainte-Foy, a young woman martyred during the fourth century. The relics of Sainte-Foy arrived in Conques through theft in 866.

      <p id="GL003_182_002" num_links="2">The original monastery building at Conques was an eighth-century oratory built by monks fleeing the Saracens in Spain.[2] The original chapel was destroyed in the eleventh century in order to facilitate the creation of a much larger church [3] as the arrival of the relics of Sainte-Foy caused the pilgrimage route to shift from <link wikipedia="Agen" osm="1871910362 146357" type="node relation">Agen</link> to Conques.[2] The second phase of construction, which was completed by the end of the 11th century, included the building of the five radiating chapels, the ambulatory with a lower roof, the choir without the gallery and the nave without the galleries.[3] The third phase of construction, which was completed early in the twelfth-century, was inspired by the churches of Toulouse and Santiago de Compostela. Like most pilgrimage churches Conques is a basilica plan that has been modified into a cruciform plan.[4] Galleries were added over the aisle and the roof was raised over the transept and choir to allow people to circulate at the gallery level. The western aisle was also added to allow for increased pilgrim traffic.[5] The exterior length of the church is 59 meters. The interior length is 56 meters. the width of each transept is 4 meters.

These include a shield bearing the arms of the Freeminers on the west wall and a mid-15th century octagonal font, that has tools of miners and metalworkers incised on its sides. Abenhall is a tiny, ancient village in a secluded quiet valley near Mitcheldean. The parish includes the settlement of Plump Hill, on the Mitcheldean to Cinderford Road as it climbs into the high Forest. Abenhall is on the Flaxley to Mitcheldean Road. Originally a mining and iron making centre, it is notable for its 14th century Church of St Michael, which is built of local red sandstone and has excellent contemporary carvings relating to the Forest of Dean's industries. These include a shield bearing the arms of the Freeminers on the west wall and the fabulous mid-15th century octagonal font, that has tools of miners and metalworkers incised on its sides.
