Saint-Gaudens was specially selected for the commission after a design competition failed to produce a winning artist.  Saint-Gaudens, who revered the President, had seen Lincoln at the time of his inauguration, and later viewed Lincoln's body lying in state. For his design, the artist also relied on a life mask and hand casts made of Lincoln in 1860 by Leonard W. Volk.[2]  While planning and working on the Standing Lincoln, Saint-Gaudens was first enticed to what would become <link wikipedia="Saint-Gaudens_National_Historical_Park" osm="7837744" type="relation">his home and studio</link>, and an associated artist's colony.

He received a land grant of 582 acres (236 ha) around 1732 from Alexander Ross and Morgan Bryan, though he had to later renegotiate the grant with Lord Fairfax, who owned all the land between the <link wikipedia="Potomac_River" osm="87759965 2636997 2636998 2636999 2637000 2637001" type="way relation relation relation relation relation">Potomac</link> and <link wikipedia="Rappahannock_River" osm="177638" type="relation">Rappahannock Rivers</link>.[3][4][5]  Some historians believe Hollingsworth was also required to pay local Shawnee members a cow, a calf, and a piece of red cloth for the land.  Hollingsworth, considered the founder of Winchester, described his land a "delight to behold."[3][6]  He built a log cabin next to a natural spring and just west of where the current house is located.  Although the cabin no longer stands, the cabin's hand-dug well is still visible.  Historians believe a wooden stockade once surrounded his home and that he began construction of the present house before his death in 1748.  His widow, Ann Robinson (born around 1690), inherited the property but died the following year.  Their second son, Isaac (1722–1759), a Quaker minister, inherited the property and made plans for a house that could also serve as a Quaker meeting place.  Simon Taylor was chosen to build the home.  He had recently completed construction of Springdale for Colonel John Hite, now the oldest house in <link wikipedia="Frederick_County,_Virginia" osm="1633327" type="relation">Frederick County</link>, and the two homes share similar stonework.  Quakers held meetings in the Hollingsworth house with men sitting in the parlor and women in the dining room.[4][5]

The lighthouse is open to public visitation and, for a small donation, one may climb to the watch room and external gallery.  A re-creation of the keepers' quarters was opened in 2002 and serves as a museum and gift shop. The original oil house now contains a Fresnel lens exhibit.

In 1678 the academy was formally founded as the Academy of Painters, Sculptors and Architects (Accademia dei Pittori, Scultori e Architetti) by Marie Jeanne of Savoy. It was re-established under the name Albertina in 1833 by Charles Albert of Sardinia, who had architect Giuseppe Talucchi design and realize a new building on the former site of the convent of the Church of San Francesco da Paola. The academy witnessed the transition of artistic movements during the late 19th to early 20th century, from realism to eclecticism and the Liberty style, in the works of painters Antonio Fontanesi and Giacomo Grosso, and sculptors Vincenzo Vela and Odoardo Tabacchi. Turin became a leading centre of visual arts during the mid-20th century.[1][2]
