In 1897, construction of a 110 km railroad from Ekibastuz commenced. The Voskresensk railroad crossed the area of the future town. A wharf was erected where the railroad reached the <link wikipedia="Irtysh_River" osm="2098340 4847826" type="relation relation">Irtysh River</link>, and two settlements appeared: an administrative settlement and a workers settlement.  The newcomers had to build their houses using local materials: clay, reed and thatch. In this way, at the turn of the 20th century a small village made of wattle-and-daub houses arose close to Kazakh Aul No. 5 in the Kyzyl-Shyrpy Stow. The village was known under the name of Glinka (from Russian 'глина' – clay).
The population of Glinka gradually increased, most intensively after the riots of 1906, when out-migrants poured into the Kazakh and Siberian steppe.

      <p id="GL009_217_002" num_links="2">The restaurant as it is today came into being in 1950 when Al Bergstrom parted ways with another neighborhood restaurateur.  Bergstrom had gained experience at the griddle and in kitchen management in the 1940s while working for John L. "Jack" Robinson during summers at a popular <link wikipedia="Minnesota_State_Fair" osm="39662664" type="way">Minnesota State Fair</link> cafeteria.  The Dinkytown building he purchased dates back to 1937 when a neighboring <link wikipedia="Hardware_store" osm="3067760238 6556217336" type="node node">hardware store</link> erected a shed in the alleyway to hold sheet metal and plumbing parts.  This was eventually rented out and was a Hunky Dory hamburger stand by the time Bergstrom took it over.  The new owner renamed the diner to Al's Café and first opened the doors on May 15.  Initially, he produced three meals a day, seven days a week, but scaled back the operation to simply be a breakfast outlet after one year.

The Al Fattan Marine Towers consist of two twin 50-story towers, the Al Fattan Tower, and the Oasis Beach Tower, consisting of serviced and residential apartments which have since been sold to individual investors and homeowners. Both towers stand at a height of 245 m (804 ft) and a roof height of 230 m (755 ft), and are the tallest buildings in Jumeirah Beach Residence. Construction of both towers was completed in 2006. Following completion the developer, Al Fattan Properties LLC built a 12-storey office and retail building on an adjacent plot between the towers and <link wikipedia="Dubai_Marina" osm="281208900" type="node">Dubai Marina</link> restricting views of the marina from the towers. In 2012 Al Fattan commenced construction of two high-rise towers on the beach in front of the towers which will largely restrict seaviews from Al Fattan Marine Towers. Al Fattan had earlier demolished a 10-story hotel on the site, the Oasis Hotel, which it had built about a decade earlier. Originally Al Fattan proposed to build a mega 97-tower building on the site to be called Burj Al Fattan, however a subsequent decision was made to split the development into two high-rise towers. The exact number of floors is not known as there has been no public disclosure of the project.
