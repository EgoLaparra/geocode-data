The Delta Steel Company (DSC), an integrated steel manufacturing industry is situated on hectares of land provided by both Ovwian and Aladja communities but the steel plant is currently redundant as a result of mismanagement. However, the federal government of Nigeria, is making concerted effort to privatize the plant. It was recently linked with a modern rail line from northern part of the country to ease the transport of raw materials (Iron ore) and finished products (steel) between the plant and other parts of the country.
Aladja, as a coastal community, it has been a haven of commerce between the coastal people and hinterland since ancient times. The act of trade by barter is still being practiced in the popular Aladja Market to this day. Aladja has served for many decades as the route to old Warri mainland via its famous 'Aladja Waterside' until the construction of the Udu Bridge in 1975 as an alternative route to Warri and its environs.

The mill and the importance of the canyon as a passage through the hills led to growth of Niles (which in 1956 became part of Fremont, California) in the 1850s. A favorable climate, excellent soils, and a fast-growing population helped agriculture to boom. Early roads led to landings where small ships would load grain and other foodstuffs for transport to market.

The sculpture's name, Alamo, is designated on a small plaque on the base and was selected by the artist's wife because its scale and mass reminded her of the <link wikipedia="Alamo_Mission_in_San_Antonio" osm="92060042" type="way">Alamo Mission</link>.[1][2]

The park contains widespread archaeological ruins from several notable past civilizations, including the Bronze Age Koban people (1200–300 BCE), and the Alans people (100 BCE – 1234 AD).  It is from the Alans that the name "Alaniya", and indirectly the term "Aryan", is ultimately derived.[2]  Because altitudes in the park can span almost 4,000 meters vertical in very short distances, the slopes and valleys display strong 'altitude zoning'.  These climatic zones range from alpine glaciers and peaks in the high, southern sections, to steppe grasslands in the northern reaches.[3]

The main building of the mansion, built by Baron Gregor von Ungern-Sternberg in 1852, was heavily damaged by local peasants during the 1905 Revolution but was rebuilt. The last individual owner of nobility was Mary von der Pahlen, who acquired it in 1907. During the Estonian Land Reform in 1919, the manor's lands were nationalized.

Under the REDA, the Alberta Government established the AER in December 2012 to provide a one-stop shop for regulatory approvals after industry complained about the delays and costs of red tape. The legislation combined duties of the Energy Resources Conservation Board with responsibilities of Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development to create a single entity to administer the Public Lands Act,[2] the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act[3] and the Water Act.[4][5][6] The AER operates at arm's length from the Government of Alberta, under an appointed board of directors headed by Chair Gerry Protti, a former president of the oil industry lobby Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. On 17 June 2013, all regulatory functions previously carried out by the Energy Resources Conservation Board were taken over by the Alberta Energy Regulator.[7]
