The wood and steel grandstands, built in the 1940s, were condemned and demolished in 1996, replaced with the current east grandstand, along with a temporary structure on the west side, adjacent to Alfond Arena. The current west grandstand, lights, press and luxury levels, as well as concessions and restroom amenities were completed prior to the 1998 season. The stadium was rededicated to Harold Alfond, a longtime Maine booster, at Maine's first home night game on September 12, 1998, a 52-28 win over New Hampshire in the Battle for the Brice-Cowell Musket. The field is named for Phillip and Susan Morse, who donated the lights, original Astroturf and scoreboard. In the summer of 2008, new FieldTurf was installed to replace the old AstroTurf. In 2014, a 20'x32' high-definition video-board replaced the matrix display installed in 1998, and a contemporary scoreboard was installed on the north end.

      <p id="GL012_239_001" num_links="4">Alfred Lichtwark was the son of Herr Johann Karl Ernst Lichtwark, a minor lord who owned the Reitbrook Mill. From his father's first marriage he had three half-siblings.  Alfred Lichtwark's mother Johanne Helene Henrietta (née Bach) (1829–1909) was believed to be a direct descendant of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach. Lichtwark had a happy childhood in the countryside with his siblings Hans and Marianne (1857–1930) until 1858, when his father was forced to sell the mill for financial reasons. The family moved to Hamburg, where his father ran an inn which fared poorly, and the family lived in poverty. Lichtwark, who attended the civil school, proved to be very talented and versatile, helping students after school as an assistant teacher. In 1873 he took the Abitur at the <link wikipedia="Gymnasium_Christianeum" osm="631569128" type="way">Christianeum</link> in <link wikipedia="Altona,_Hamburg" osm="30223" type="relation">Altona</link>.

After finishing his studies he worked at several primary and civil schools in Berlin.  Lichtwark was very disenchanted with the educational system that existed at that time in Imperial Germany, which led him to the idea of a new kind of school or pedagogy.

Indians of the Ice Age Clovis Culture used Alibates flint for spear points to hunt the Imperial Mammoth before the Great Lakes were formed. The flint usually lies just below the surface at ridge level in a layer up to six feet thick. The quarry pits were not very large, between 5 and 25 feet wide and 4 to 7 feet deep.[5] Many of these quarries were exploited by the Antelope Creek people, of the Panhandle culture, between 1200 and 1450.  The stone-slabbed, multi-room houses built by the Antelope Creek people have long been of interest to the public and studied by archaeologists.

      <p id="GL012_493_001" num_links="5">Alkhanay National Park (Russian: Национальный парк «Алханай») encompasses the area around Mt. Alkhanai, a central focus and sacred mountain to the Buryats people, who today are the largest indigenous group in Siberia.  Mt. Alkanai has been adopted as sacred by later Mongols, shamanistic people, and Buddhists.  The Dalai Lama has made two unofficial visits to Alkhanay.  The area takes its name from an old legend, in which a princess took refuge from her pursuers on the top of the mountain, defiantly shouting as they approached, "kill me!", which translates to "Alkhanai" in the local language.  Despite the ancient name, the focus today of Buddhist pilgrims as they ascend the mountain pathway is one of peacefulness and healing.  The park seeks to balance support for continued pilgrimage to the rock landforms and mineral springs, with conservation of nature and recreational tourism.[1]  Alkhanay NP is located in the Trans-Baikal (<link wikipedia="Siberia" osm="5332639323" type="node">East Siberia</link>) region of <link wikipedia="Russia" osm="424314830 60189" type="node relation">Russia</link>, about 300 miles east of the lake, and 75 miles north of <link wikipedia="Mongolia" osm="432425040 161033" type="node relation">Mongolia</link>'s northern border.
