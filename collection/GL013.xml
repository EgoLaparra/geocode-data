      <p id="GL013_171_001" num_links="4">Alfred Lichtwark was the son of Herr Johann Karl Ernst Lichtwark, a minor lord who owned the Reitbrook Mill. From his father's first marriage he had three half-siblings.  Alfred Lichtwark's mother Johanne Helene Henrietta (née Bach) (1829–1909) was believed to be a direct descendant of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach. Lichtwark had a happy childhood in the countryside with his siblings Hans and Marianne (1857–1930) until 1858, when his father was forced to sell the mill for financial reasons. The family moved to Hamburg, where his father ran an inn which fared poorly, and the family lived in poverty. Lichtwark, who attended the civil school, proved to be very talented and versatile, helping students after school as an assistant teacher. In 1873 he took the Abitur at the <link wikipedia="Gymnasium_Christianeum" osm="631569128" type="way">Christianeum</link> in <link wikipedia="Altona,_Hamburg" osm="30223" type="relation">Altona</link>.

After finishing his studies he worked at several primary and civil schools in Berlin.  Lichtwark was very disenchanted with the educational system that existed at that time in Imperial Germany, which led him to the idea of a new kind of school or pedagogy.

Indians of the Ice Age Clovis Culture used Alibates flint for spear points to hunt the Imperial Mammoth before the Great Lakes were formed.

The quarry pits were not very large, between 5 and 25 feet wide and 4 to 7 feet deep.[5] Many of these quarries were exploited by the Antelope Creek people, of the Panhandle culture, between 1200 and 1450.  The stone-slabbed, multi-room houses built by the Antelope Creek people have long been of interest to the public and studied by archaeologists.
