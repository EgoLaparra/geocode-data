Howell. In 1822,[6] it was then purchased by philanthropist James P. Allaire, who endeavoured to turn into a self-contained community.[7] The wood burning furnace business collapsed in 1846 and the village closed. Following his death, the property passed through a number of family members before being used by the Boy Scouts who started to restore the buildings for use as a summer camp. Losing the lease, the property then passed to the State of New Jersey. Allaire Village and its existing buildings are now operated by a non-profit organization - Allaire Village, Inc.

Allegheny County Airport was dedicated on September 11, 1931.[2][3][4][5] When it was completed, it was third-largest airport in the country, as well as the only hard-surface airport in the country.[2] It was historically the main entrance to metro Pittsburgh via air from its inception until June 1952, when the Greater Pittsburgh Airport (now Pittsburgh International Airport – KPIT) opened for commercial aviation.[2][6] Like many historic municipal fields, Allegheny serves small and mid-sized private, corporate and commercial traffic well, but was not built to handle jet airliners. A Boeing 727 owned by Rockwell and two DC-9's however were based on the field for years. One DC-9, owned by Westinghouse Air Brake, operated from the former TWA hangar. Another DC-9 was owned by Richard Scaife. Additionally, political candidates often operate chartered jet airliners into the field. Air Force 2, a Boeing 757, has been on the airport in the 2000s. In May 2017, a Southwest Boeing 737 with 143 passengers en route from Orlando, made a precautionary landing when running low on fuel.

As a black church, Allen Chapel served as a center of Lincoln's small African-American community. The church hosted the community's religious and social events, and as an AME church it provided AME publications to and helped educate its members. As Lincoln was both segregated and predominantly white for much of the church's early history, the church played an important role as one of the few organizations dedicated to improving the lives of the city's black residents.

It was originally designed as a silent movie theater by C. Howard Crane and opened its doors on April 1, 1921, with a capacity of more than 3,000 seats.[1] The first show was of the movie Her Greatest Love, and featured Phil Spitalny and his 35 piece orchestra as live performers. The theater was designed in the Italian Renaissance style and was one of the few "daylight atmospheric" theaters in the country, with a ceiling painted to resemble the open daylight sky.[2] In the lobby, a rotunda was built to resemble the <link wikipedia="Villa_Madama" osm="255653646" type="way">Villa Madama</link> in <link wikipedia="Rome" osm="72959652" type="node">Rome</link>.

      <p id="GL014_198_002" num_links="3">By the mid-1960s, financial troubles plagued both the Allen and the other downtown theaters. These were primarily caused by the popularity of television and the growing desire for local residents to move away from the city and into the suburbs. On May 7, 1968, the Allen Theatre was closed; it remained vacant for nearly 30 years. The Playhouse Square Association was formed in 1970, and began the revitalization process of the <link wikipedia="Connor_Palace" osm="1736369852" type="node">Connor Palace</link>, <link wikipedia="State_Theatre_(Cleveland,_Ohio)" osm="1736369982" type="node">State</link> and <link wikipedia="Ohio_Theatre_(Cleveland,_Ohio)" osm="1736369931" type="node">Ohio Theatres</link>; but the Allen remained closed and slated for possible demolition until 1993, when the Playhouse Square Foundation agreed to purchase it.[2] Fully restored to its former glory, the Allen Theatre reopened on October 3, 1998, with 2,500 seats and became an important venue for hosting touring Broadway musicals and concerts.[1]

At the time of Canadian Confederation in 1867, Alberta was still owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, and European missionaries spread Christianity through the native tribes. In 1904, prior to Alberta becoming a province, homesteaders arrived in the area to establish ranches. By 1910, the area surrounding what is now Alliance was well populated by Europeans, and in January 1916, the Canadian Northern Railway arrived in the young community. The name 'Alliance' was chosen by resident Tom Edwards, who named the community after his home city in the United States, <link wikipedia="Alliance,_Ohio" osm="154347430 182681" type="node relation">Alliance, Ohio</link>.

It was replaced by a manor house, which was fortified with royal permission in the 13th century. Various alterations and expansions were made by successive owners over the following two centuries. The property was developed into a fortified compound with six towers at irregular intervals along the curtain wall and domestic buildings in the interior, including one of the first long galleries built in England. In 1554 it was seized by the Crown in the course of dispossessing its owner, Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger, after the failure of his rebellion against Queen Mary.
