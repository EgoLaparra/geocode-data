The Ammergau Alps are an ideal region for the average walker thanks to the comparatively low height of their summits and their location on the northern edge of the Alps with its proximity to the population centres of south Germany. Most of the summits are accessible within a day's round trip from bases in the valleys. As a result, there is only a small number of Alpine Club huts. Neither are there many cable cars or lifts. There are just two cable cars on the northern perimeter - the Tegelberg and Laber Bergbahn - and three chair lifts: to the <link wikipedia="Halblech" osm="76060608 448296" type="node relation">Buchenberg</link>, Hörnle and Kolben Saddle. In the central and southern areas there are no lifts or accommodation huts at all. The Ammergau Alps are a relatively natural, undeveloped range with a very low population density. It is the largest Bavarian nature reserve.

      <p id="GL017_112_001" num_links="2">The Roman Amphitheatre of <link wikipedia="Catania" osm="39230" type="relation">Catania</link> was an imposing structure built in the Roman Imperial period, probably in the 2nd century AD, on the northern edge of the ancient city at the base of the Montevergine hill. Only a small section of the structure is now visible, below ground level, to the north of <link wikipedia="Piazza_Stesicoro" osm="409581298" type="way">Piazza Stesicoro</link>. This area is now the historic centre of the city, but was then on the outskirts of the ancient town and also occupied by the necropoleis of Catania [it]. The structure is part of the Parco archeologico greco-romano di Catania [it].

</p>
      <p id="GL017_112_002" num_links="3">The amphitheatre of Catania is the most complicated and largest of all the amphitheatres in Sicily. It is one of a group of large arenas, which also includes the <link wikipedia="Colosseum" osm="6635678310 1834818" type="node relation">Colosseum</link>, the Amphitheatre of Capua, and the <link wikipedia="Verona_Arena" osm="311873" type="relation">Verona Arena</link>. The structure centred on an elliptical arena, surrounded by radial walls and vaults supporting the seating of the cavea, which had 14 steps and 32 aisles. A gallery ran around the outside of the structure, on which the external facade is mounted. The arena had a maximum diameter of 70 metres and a minor diameter of around 50 metres, with a circumference of 192 metres. The external diameter was 125 x 105 metres, while the external circumference was 309 metres.  Opus vittatum was used for the construction of the interior and opus quadratum for the exterior. The remains of the pilasters are in opus quadratum with small blocks of igneous rock. The cavea was made of basalt from <link wikipedia="Mount_Etna" osm="58999222" type="node">Mount Etna</link>, faced with marble. The external walls indicate a degree of carelessness in construction. The blocks are cut irregularly and seem to mostly have been recycled. The external arches are made with large rectangular bricks of regular shape and good quality mortar, while the internal ones are made of concrete, with large radial plates. Despite the overall sobriety of the building, the contrast between the colour of the very dark igneous rock of the walls and the red bricks of the arches must have been very striking. A note of class was added by the employment of marble, not only for the cladding of the podium, but also for some decorations, such as the herms on the sides of the main entrance. The main stairs were probably made of limestone, creating a strong interplay with the white of the seating and the black of the other stairways. A cover with large awnings to protect people from strong sun and rain probably existed.

The remaining portions of Anaheim Hills were primarily developed in the 1970s after rancher and land owner Louis Nohl sold his massive parcel in the foothills east of Anaheim. The area was taken over by <link wikipedia="Texaco" osm="207738835" type="way">Texaco Industries</link> in 1970 when the company announced plans to develop an expansive and upscale master planned community of 7,000 homes, estates, and townhomes. The original master plan included a proposal for three new lakes with high density condominiums clustered around these water features.  The initial master plan proved to be unsustainable due to the topography and geology of the area.[4] Construction of the community began in 1971 and was branded as a rural enclave and alternative to the more dense subdivisions emerging in the Orange County basin with homes on large lots, hiking trails, a golf course, and low densities. Anaheim Hills is the first residential development to utilize "Landform Grading."[5] The community grew quickly and by 1974 the Orange Unified School District had constructed a high school to serve the growing community.[6] 
In 1990, the city of Anaheim approved several large developments surrounding Weir Canyon Road (East Hills and The Highlands) expanding the community toward the <link wikipedia="California_State_Route_241" osm="151830 151832" type="relation relation">241 toll road</link>.

A fine statue of Neokles (a local potentate, son of Herodoros) was unearthed by Russian archaeologists and is now on exhibit at the <link wikipedia="Russian_Museum" osm="2614475" type="relation">Russian Museum</link>. Gorgippia was inhabited until the 3rd century CE, when it was overrun by nomadic tribes. These tribes, of Circassian or Adyghe origin, gave Anapa its modern name.

The hotel outgrew its original building due to Anchorage's growth in the 1930s, so the Anchorage Hotel Annex was built in 1936 to house additional guests. The annex, designed by E. Ellsworth Sedille, had a Gothic design and was one of the tallest buildings in Anchorage at the time. Guests at the hotel included Warren Harding, Harold L. Ickes, Walt Disney, Wiley Post, and Will Rogers; the latter two stayed at the hotel only two days prior to their deaths in a plane crash.
