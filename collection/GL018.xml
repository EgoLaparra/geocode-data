When images of the glacier taken in the early 1900s are compared with those of the early 2000s, Andrews Glacier is showing a negative glacier mass balance which indicates the glacier is retreating.[3]

There are 4 islands on the lake: Androscoggin Island, Blodgett Island, Lothrop Island and Norris Island. The islands support a diverse assemblage of rare species and natural communities.

“Two exhibitions in 1962 announced Andy Warhol’s dramatic entry into the art world. In July, at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, he exhibited his now-iconic Campbell’s Soup Cans. The work’s 32 canvases, each one featuring a different variety of the company’s 32 soups, were lined up in a single row on a ledge that wrapped around the gallery. “Cans sit on shelves,” the gallery director, Irving Blum, later said of the installation. “Why not?” 1 The paintings marked a breakthrough for Warhol, who had previously worked as a commercial illustrator: they were among his first works based on consumer goods, and among the first to embrace serial repetition. Although he hand-painted each canvas, they were made to seem mechanically produced”(MoAndy Warhol
American, 1928–1987,MoMA).

The first mention of this small territory is to be found in the documentation of the monastery of San Xoán de Caaveiro (18km away), and belong chronologically to the 9th century. It was part of the region of Pruzos, which was created as an administrative and ecclesiastical territory of Kingdom of Galicia in the sixth century by King Teodomiro (reigned 559-570) through a document written in Latin called Parrochiale suevum, Parochiale suevorum or Theodomiri Divisio. From the 12th century Pruzos, and therefore Andrade, were integrated into the county of Trastámara that belonged to the lineage Traba, the most powerful Galician family. By this same time the family group: Fortúnez, begins to unite their names Andrade as surname, since in this parish their family home was located. The knights of Andrade were faithful vassals of their lords the Counts of Trastámara throughout the middle centuries of the Middle Ages.

His sons W. B. and S. Anglin established the Anglin company as a sawmill at Wellington and Bay streets, at the mouth of the Cataraqui River, employing 23 people by 1850. Coal was soon added as a sideline, gradually displaced by fuel oil from 1953 onward. Anglin once handled a quarter million tons a year of heating and industrial coal[1] and operated substantial lumber, drydock and shipbuilding facilities.[2] In the 1950s, a custom carpentry shop employed 60-70 workers. The last Anglin lumber was sold in 1979.[3] The company remained within the Anglin family until 1997. Its successor, heating company Tri-Heat Anglin Energy Supply, moved to its current Counter Street location (now John Counter Boulevard) in 1999. It was acquired in the early 2000s by local competitor Rosen Fuels and operated as Rosen TriHeat Anglin Fuels until 2012, ultimately becoming Rosen Energy Group.

Baptist worship in the area can be traced back to 1846, when the "strangely towered"[1] Church of Christ was founded and built.  After the Gothic-style chapel became unsuitable for modern requirements, the congregation acquired a nearby barn and converted it into a new church, after which the old building was sold for residential conversion. The church has been designated a Grade II Listed building.

      <p id="GL018_499_002" num_links="2">Angoche is an old Muslim trading centre, which local tradition states was founded in the 1490s by refugees from the Kilwa Sultanate. Xosa, the son of one of the leaders of the refugees, was made the first sultan. One of the earliest settlements in <link wikipedia="Mozambique" osm="424311658 195273" type="node relation">Mozambique</link> and an important gold and ivory trading post, it posed a serious rival to the Portuguese settlement in Mozambigue until the mid-16th century, when Angoche was eclipsed by <link wikipedia="Quelimane" osm="259593870" type="node">Quelimane</link> as an entry port to the interior.[1] However, Angoche continued to play a role in coastal trade and was an important economic and political centre in the region, with close ties to Ilha de Moçambique. In the 19th century, Angoche became the focus of the clandestine slave trade, which continued until the 1860s when the town was attacked by the Portuguese. While effective Portuguese administration was not established until several decades later, the attack marked the beginning of Angoche's downfall, and the town never regained its former status.[2]

This strategic position explains the successive foundations of this city during the Arauco War. It was first founded in 1553 as a "conquistador" fort of Confines, the fort was later destroyed and rebuilt several times and it was not until the Pacification of Araucania in the late 19th century that it was rebuilt with the name of Angol. The city has a current population of approximately 49,000. Within the electoral divisions of Chile, it belongs to the 48th electoral district and the 14th senatorial circumscription.
