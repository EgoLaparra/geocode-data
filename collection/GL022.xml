This area was settled in 1703 on the old Indian trail from the big bend in the river heading west to Core Point. The community was called “Bethany Crossroads”. That Indian trail is still in use today but is now called North Carolina Highway 306. In 1886 Bob Hardison, after discussing it with his friend Bob Bowden decided to apply to the U.S. Postal Department for a Post office to be located at “Bethany Crossroads” in Pamlico County. They filled out an application and both signed it. When it was returned to them it was addressed to “Bob’s Town”, the reason being that there was already a “Bethany Crossroads” in the vicinity of <link wikipedia="Fayetteville,_North_Carolina" osm="179846" type="relation">Fayetteville</link>. Neither of the Bobs liked “Bob’s Town” so they had to come up with a different name. After a lengthy discussion Bob Hardison said “Well if you have no objection, we will name it after my old white horse, Arapahoe.” So it was decided and a new application filed. It was likely a year or longer before all paperwork was completed, but “Bethany Crossroads” was no more and there by named the Town of Arapahoe. Arapahoe is a Native American tribe whose historic territory spanned regions of present-day Wyoming and Colorado.

      <p id="GL022_115_001" num_links="5">A bazaar is a permanently enclosed marketplace or street where goods and services are exchanged or sold. The term originates from the Persian word bāzār.

</p>
      <p id="GL022_115_002" num_links="6">Evidence for the existence of bazaars dates to around 3,000 BCE. Although the lack of archaeological evidence has limited detailed studies of the evolution of bazaars, indications suggest that they initially developed outside city walls where they were often associated with servicing the needs of caravanserai. As towns and cities became more populous, these bazaars moved into the city center and developed in a linear pattern along streets stretching from one city gate to another gate on the opposite side of the city. Over time, these bazaars formed a network of trading centres which allowed for the exchange of produce and information. The rise of large bazaars and stock trading centres in the Muslim world allowed the creation of new capitals and eventually new empires.

Because of the prevalence of similar species in ancient prehistory, it is sometimes called a living fossil. It is also the national tree of Chile. Its conservation status was changed to Endangered by the IUCN in 2013 due to the dwindling population caused by logging, forest fires, and grazing.[1]

The town's business leaders commissioned the arch as a landmark for the town which was intended to improve the appearance of its business district. The arch was formally dedicated on September 30, 1921; the dedication honored the town's World War I veterans, although the arch was not intended to be a memorial. The structure remains in good condition and has become a popular attraction for visitors to the area.[2]

The monument served both as a commemorative arch and as an approach to Gerasa. The Arch's relative remoteness from the city walls points to a plan for southward expansion of Gerasa during its heyday.[1] The expansion, however, has not been implemented.

It expanded in the 1950s and doubled its floor space with a refurbishment under curator Dimitri Baramki, which opened to the public in 1964. The museum remained open during the years of crisis in Lebanon between 1975 and 1990 and underwent another complete renovation in 2006 under the present director, Leila Badre. A mezzanine level was added that increased the space by one fifth using funds secured from the Joukowsky Family Foundation.[5] The AUB Archaeological Museum is the third oldest museum in the Near East, after Cairo and Constantinople[6]
