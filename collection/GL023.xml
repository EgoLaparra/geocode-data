As a result, a person's house is not taxed, only the land it sits on, which is owned in by a charitable trust and managed by three directors. Half the land is woods and open space. Footpaths criss-cross the village.  At its founding in 1950, Ardencroft formally encouraged minorities to settle there, seeking families that wanted to live in an integrated setting.  The nearby, former Arden School (now the Buzz Ware Village Center) also allowed integration around this time, prior to many of the changes enacted by the Civil Rights Movement.

There is other significant Etruscan evidence: parts of walls, an Etruscan necropolis on Poggio del Sole (still named "Hill of the Sun"), and most famously, the two bronzes, the "<link wikipedia="Chimera_of_Arezzo" osm="3743272599" type="node">Chimera of Arezzo</link>" (5th century BC) and the "Minerva" (4th century BC) which were discovered in the 16th century and taken to <link wikipedia="Florence" osm="61753360 42602" type="node relation">Florence</link>.

Originally conceived of by Art Simonson and Gerhardt (Gay) Stabney (the “Ar” and “Gay” of Argay) as a “move-up” suburban family neighborhood alternative to Portland’s congested inner-city, Argay Terrace built out as planned with larger, better quality homes on large lots spread out over the gently sloping terrain that gave the area an open feeling and many of its homes stunning views of Mt. Hood and Mt. St. Helens. Homes are typical of the style called “Mid-Century Modern” with a mix of one story ranches (most with basements or daylight basements), split entry, split level, and even some modern two story colonials.

</p>
      <p id="GL023_377_002" num_links="2">Alex Liberman's impressive steel sculpture was originally located in an outdoor exhibition in <link wikipedia="Newport,_Rhode_Island" osm="158837846 191230" type="node relation">Newport, Rhode Island</link>. Mrs. Harry Lynde (Peg) Bradley purchased the sculpture because she determined it would complement the architecture of the newly enlarged <link wikipedia="Milwaukee_Art_Museum" osm="51865486" type="way">Milwaukee Art Center</link> building, which had been largely financed by the Bradley funds. Argo became the first sculpture on the grounds of the museums new wing. With its form of white circles and cylinders, the sculpture not only enhances the building, but, when viewed from the west, appears to float on the surface of the water. This effect is exactly as the artist intended, as implied by the title, Argo-the heroic adventure ship of the ancient Greeks.[2]
Argo, with its reflective white epoxy paint finish and correct sitting, is a fine example of the Artist's 1970's style of monumental geometric sculpture. During this period the artist was interested in the interplay between positive and negative spaces. Examples of other Liberman styles and sculptures can be seen at the Bradley Sculpture Garden.

However, Hill's company located the new railroad town just south of the Louisa property line and named it Argyle. The early settlement included many French-Canadians. Other settlers included immigrants from England, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Scotland, and Germany. The early townspeople and businessmen were always anxious to make Argyle an attractive community to the region. Today the community still boasts of several businesses, which draw customers from the regional area. Because of threats of flooding, a dike was built on the Middle River which is a branch of the <link wikipedia="Red_River_of_the_North" osm="1573833" type="relation">Red River</link> in 1988.

This tax led, in 1816, to the current community.  However, the town councils of the three villages didn't unite until 1912.[3]
