Ocampo came from Anaime, <link wikipedia="Tolima_Department" osm="1309495" type="relation">Tolima</link>, looking for shelter in the mountains of Quindío because he was running away from General Gallo.

Ocampo then proceeded to sell land for settlement. To encourage settlement, Ocampo returned to Anaime to ask for the help of his friend Juan de la Cruz Cardona and to marry thirteen-year-old Arsenia Cardona. Six months after its founding, in August 1890, Armenia had reached a population of 100 people, allowing it to gain legal recognition by the government. In the founding meeting of the city, on October 14, 1889, the name of Villa Holguín was suggested, in honor of Carlos Holguín Mallarino, the then-current president of the country. However, the proposal was rejected, and the name Armenia was put to a vote and approved on November 30, 1889.[2] Therefore, the belief that the name was changed to Armenia after <link wikipedia="Armenia" osm="249399277 364066" type="node relation">the country of the same name</link>, in memory of the Armenian people murdered by the Turkish Ottomans in the Hamidian Massacres of 1894–97 and later the Armenian Genocide of 1915–23 is substantiated.

The county seat was finally located at Rockville in 1822.[4] The original plat of the town was destroyed along with many other records in an 1832 fire in Rockville;[5] the town was platted again in 1833.[6]
