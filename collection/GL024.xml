The college operated both the Jenkintown and Glenside campuses until 1962, when it consolidated all activities to the Glenside campus. Some significant changes came in 1973, when the college launched its first graduate programs and began admitting men again. The rise of the internet, with systems designed to filter out sexually explicit material, repeatedly blocked access to the college's website. Research conducted by the institution found that, because of its name, the institution appealed to 30% fewer prospective students.  In June 2001, trustees voted to apply for university status and to change the name.[2] In July 2001, upon attaining university status, Beaver College officially changed its name to Arcadia University.[3]

It is an 11-metre high triple-arched gateway erected to honor the visit of Roman Emperor Hadrian to the city (then called Gerasa) in the winter of 129–130.[1] The arch originally stood to almost 22 m and probably had wooden doors.[1] It features some unconventional, possibly Nabataean, architectural features, such as acanthus bases.[2] The columns are decorated with capitals at the bottom rather than the top. The monument served both as a commemorative arch and as an approach to Gerasa. The Arch's relative remoteness from the city walls points to a plan for southward expansion of Gerasa during its heyday.[1] The expansion, however, has not been implemented.

It expanded in the 1950s and doubled its floor space with a refurbishment under curator Dimitri Baramki, which opened to the public in 1964. The museum remained open during the years of crisis in Lebanon between 1975 and 1990 and underwent another complete renovation in 2006 under the present director, Leila Badre. A mezzanine level was added that increased the space by one fifth using funds secured from the Joukowsky Family Foundation.[5] The AUB Archaeological Museum is the third oldest museum in the Near East, after Cairo and Constantinople[6]

The archive holds over 600 funds dating back to the 8th century which, laid out in a line, would stretch over 75 km (46 miles).

Until 1989, the archive was located in the <link wikipedia="Uffizi" osm="23298781" type="way">Uffizi</link>. On November 4th, 1966 the River Arno flooded, causing damage to over 60,000 pieces of archival material.[2]    The flood incited the decision to construct a modern building for the archives further from the River Arno. The new building, designed by Italo Gamberini and his team of architects, was begun in 1974. [3] It included a space for the restoration laboratory, which was founded shortly after the 1966 to recover damaged documents.[4] Between 1987-1988 archival materials were transferred from the Uffizi to their current location, on the Viale della Giovine Italia, near the Piazza Beccaria in Florence. The new building Staff have included Gaetano Milanesi among others.[5]

The bridge carried the Old Croton Aqueduct over the highway until 1924, when the bridge was deemed to be a traffic hazard and was demolished. The aqueduct was then rerouted to flow beneath the highway. In November 1998, long after the aqueduct was shut down, the bridge was replaced as a crossing for aqueduct walkers, bikers, and equestrians over the particularly dangerous section of the highway.[2] The new bridge connects the <link wikipedia="Rockefeller_State_Park_Preserve" osm="4079996" type="relation">Rockefeller State Park Preserve</link> with Rockwood Hall, and was built to resemble the two bridges over Route 117 which the Rockefellers had built.[3]

These initial assaults were beaten back by Austrian firepower. By 17 November, French flanking moves convinced Alvinczi that he was threatened with encirclement and he ordered a tactical withdrawal. The following year Napoleon went on to crush the Austrians at Rivoli, forcing them to sign the Peace of Campo Formio later that year.

As a result, a person's house is not taxed, only the land it sits on, which is owned in by a charitable trust and managed by three directors. Half the land is woods and open space. Footpaths criss-cross the village.  At its founding in 1950, Ardencroft formally encouraged minorities to settle there, seeking families that wanted to live in an integrated setting.  The nearby, former Arden School (now the Buzz Ware Village Center) also allowed integration around this time, prior to many of the changes enacted by the Civil Rights Movement.

One of the two smaller churches is a fine example of late Romanesque and the other is a plain 15th century structure with a carving of a wyvern on one of the windows.[2][3] In the north-east corner is a double rectangular niche containing a grotesque head with lips pulled back to reveal large teeth.
