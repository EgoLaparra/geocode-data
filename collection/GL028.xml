The canal was taken over by the Midland Railway in 1846, but remained profitable until the 1890s, after which it steadily declined. Around 9 miles (14 km) passed through the Leicestershire coal field, and was heavily affected by subsidence, with the result that this section from Moira, southwards to Snarestone, was progressively closed in 1944, 1957 and 1966, leaving 22 miles (35 km) of navigable canal.

      <p id="GL028_372_002" num_links="2">Petroglyphs (rock art) found throughout the Forest suggest that the land had been hunted for centuries by Indians before the arrival of Europeans. The first white men believed to have set foot in Ashley National Forest were the Spanish explorers Dominques and Escalante, in 1776.  The Forest, however, was not thoroughly explored until the early 19th century when General William Henry Ashley, an organizer of a fur company, began looking for an outlet to the Gulf of Mexico for his business.  General Ashley and his team began making their way up the <link wikipedia="Green_River_(Colorado_River_tributary)" osm="360172007 445604 4008704" type="way relation relation">Green River</link> (one of the many bodies of water located in the Forest) in the spring of 1825.  After passing through the Flaming Gorge, General Ashley was convinced by the local Indians to turn around and head back up the Uinta Mountains.  During his exploration, General Ashley wrote and hung his name out over one of the rivers that he had explored, which now lies below the water of the <link wikipedia="Flaming_Gorge_Reservoir" osm="37448834 168018" type="way relation">Flaming Gorge Reservoir</link>; this is how Ashley National Forest received its name.  Many other explorers would come and explore the Forest, and eventually the first settlement in Ashley National Forest was made in 1872.  It was settled by Captain Pardon Dodds, who brought about 2,000 cattle into the Uintah Basin.  In a few years, all of the surrounding ranges were completely stocked with cattle and horses.[4]

The venture had considerable local support and official support from the <link wikipedia="The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" osm="4593317367 81369707 481406554" type="node way way">LDS Church</link>. Following successful construction and operation of the St. Anthony Railroad, Union Pacific, under the careful watch of the OSL and the Yellowstone Park Railroad Company, began plans for another railroad from St. Anthony to the Madison River entrance of <link wikipedia="Yellowstone_National_Park" osm="1453306" type="relation">Yellowstone National Park</link> or to what is now known as <link wikipedia="West_Yellowstone,_Montana" osm="4965185236 142450" type="node relation">West Yellowstone</link>. For years, Union Pacific wanted improved rail access to Yellowstone's geyser basins and now to <link wikipedia="Old_Faithful_Inn" osm="24168099" type="way">Old Faithful Inn</link>, that opened in 1904. Old Faithful Inn was only 30 miles (48 km) from the Madison River entrance, nearly half the distance from the Northern Entrance at <link wikipedia="Gardiner,_Montana" osm="2495266403 142628" type="node relation">Gardiner, Montana</link> that was served by the Northern Pacific Railroad. The planned route for the new railroad was through Marysville, up Warm River Canyon into the forested Island Park country, and on over the Continental Divide at Rea's Pass into what became <link wikipedia="West_Yellowstone,_Montana" osm="4965185236 142450" type="node relation">West Yellowstone, Montana</link>.
Despite the obvious economic advantages and support, the residents of Marysville, perfectly happy without a railroad, resisted the new railroad intruding upon their land and into their lives. The matter was expeditiously resolved when Union Pacific decided to build the railroad through a new town one mile (1.6 km) west of Marysville named after the OSL Chief Engineer, William Ashton. The founding of Ashton and the first scheduled train service to Ashton both occurred in 1906 with predictable results. Ashton quickly sprang to life while Marysville slowly declined into near oblivion. One of the two founding fathers,  H. G. “Fess” Fuller, became the long-time Mayor of Ashton and the other, Charles C. Moore, went on to become Governor of Idaho.
