It was there, after contact with certain individuals who were no doubt supporters of those in power, that he was encouraged to assassinate Essad Pasha Toptani, who was scheming to overthrow the new and unstable government. Essad Pasha was regarded as a traitor for having murdered Hasan Riza Pasha, commander of Shkodër, in April 1913, and for turning the fortress of Shkodër over to Montenegro.

According to the 2001 census the parish, which includes the villages of Awbridge, Upper Ratley and Lower Ratley, had a population of 695, increasing to 712 at the 2011 Census.  Commonly the terms Upper and Lower Ratley are dropped, with locals referring to the entire area as Awbridge. Confusingly, the intersection through the village of its 3 main roads, location of the village school, and previously Post Office, is in Upper Ratley, and is denoted on Maps as such, with the mapped location of Awbridge being further towards Romsey than is generally accepted.

The Bulgarian and Macedonian name is Boymitsa/Bojmica (Cyrillic: Боймица/Бојмица) by which the town was known until the name was changed in 1927. There have been suggestions that its former name was obtained during the era of Byzantine Empire and its transliteration means strong.[citation needed] Slavic tribes, who entered the area in the 7th century AD, named the area Boymitsa, which means 'little Boymia', because the valley of <link wikipedia="Vardar" osm="2907527 5896030" type="relation relation">Axios</link> looks like the Valley of Bohemia (although during the Ottoman era the valley of <link wikipedia="Vardar" osm="2907527 5896030" type="relation relation">Axios River</link> used to be called Roumlouki, meaning 'Valley of Romans').[citation needed] The town was renamed Axioupoli on 1 January 1927, after the Axios River in its vicinity.
