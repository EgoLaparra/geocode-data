      <p id="GL036_064_002" num_links="2">The hill of Balga had been the site of an Old Prussian (Warmian) fortress called Honeda. The fort had been unsuccessfully besieged by the Wettin margrave Henry III of Meissen on his 1237 Prussian Crusade, but was eventually conquered in 1239 by the forces of the Teutonic Order, led by Grand Marshal Dietrich von Bernheim. Balga was the oldest Ordensburg constructed by the Teutonic Order in the region of present-day <link wikipedia="Kaliningrad_Oblast" osm="516618494 103906" type="node relation">Kaliningrad Oblast</link>, and was built from 1239 to control naval traffic on the <link wikipedia="Vistula_Lagoon" osm="8140878" type="relation">Vistula Lagoon</link>. With the assistance of Duke Otto I of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the Teutonic Knights defeated the Old Prussians along the coastline of Warmia and Natangia. The subjugation of these pagan peoples led Duke Świętopełk II of Pomerania to declare war against the Teutonic Order during the 1242 Prussian uprising, although he was eventually forced to abandon his participation in the uprising.[2] From 1250, Balga was the administrative centre of Kommende Balga and the seat of a Komtur of the Teutonic Knights. Many Komturs at Balga like Winrich von Kniprode or Ulrich von Jungingen later rose to the office of the Grand Master, the highest position in the Teutonic Order.

The hamlet was first settled in the early nineteenth century, and by 1895 it had a population of 300.[4]
The settlement was located on the edge of a vast lumber industry centred in the hamlet of Vivian; a spur-line of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway built in 1877 ran through Ballantrae from <link wikipedia="Whitchurch-Stouffville" osm="6189010424 2416081" type="node relation">Stouffville</link> to Jackson's Point on Lake Simcoe. In the early twentieth century, Ballantrae's population declined dramatically. Large-scale deforestation and erosion of the thin soil of northern Whitchurch Township created virtual sand deserts.[5] With the passage of the Reforestation Act (1911), the process of reclaiming these areas slowly began. The Vivian Forest, a large conservation area on the edge of Ballantrae, was established in 1924 for this purpose. The recognized anthem for Ballantrae, Ontario, is Jealousy by Roy Woods.

The library was predated by a freeholders' library in the 1860s, which eventually gave way to a reading room that was organized and funded by a women's' group in 1901. With a grant for $15,000, among other funds, a new library for the then independent City of Ballard was created as a Carnegie library. The building, located at 2026 N.W. Market Street in downtown Ballard, opened to the public on June 24, 1904.[1][2] Notable as the first major branch of the Seattle public library system, after Seattle annexed the City of Ballard into itself in 1907, and for employing one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, the Ballard Carnegie Library was in service until 1963, when a newer and more modern facility replaced it. After its sale, the old library building housed a variety of private commercial enterprises, including an antique shop, a restaurant and a kilt manufacturer.[1][2]

The entrance, with a double towered gate, is in the north wall and had twin D-shaped towers. It has a gatehouse typical of the period, the outer portions of which have almost completely disappeared. The castle, however, remains an impressive structure. The interior measures about 30 square metres (320 sq ft). There are three-quarter round towers at all four corners and also in the middle of the east and west walls.[2]  A postern gate, which was planned for the centre of the south wall, was never completed, probably because of the events of 1317, when the castle was lost to the O'Connors.

The Center is a municipal building owned and operated by the City of Baltimore. The facility was constructed in two separate phases: the original Center, with 425,000 square feet (39,500 m2) of exhibition and meeting space, opened in August 1979 at a cost of $51.4 million. A $151 million expansion, which increased the Center's total size to 1,225,000 square feet (113,800 m2) was completed in April 1997.[1] The 752-room, city-owned <link wikipedia="Hilton_Baltimore" osm="7021530" type="relation">Hilton Baltimore</link> hotel opened in August 2008, connected to the convention center by an enclosed skywalk bridge. Another expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center has been proposed at an estimated cost of $400 million that includes a new 500 room hotel and an 18,500 seat arena; this project is estimated to cost $900 million, this proposal is no longer active and considered dead. As of March 2016, the State of Maryland is going to explore expanding the Baltimore Convention Center for an estimated cost of $600 million and build a new hotel attached to the expansion. As of August 2016, the proposal of having a combined expanded convention center, arena and hotel has been revived. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake requested a $1 million feasibility study from the Maryland Stadium Authority which was approved on August 2, 2016. As of September 2017, Phase 1 of the feasibility study has begun with the release expected to be sometime by the end of 2017[2]. On July 6, 2018, the Maryland Stadium Authority finally released Phase 1 of the feasibility study. Phase 1 gives the ultimate recommendation of demolishing the 1979 eastern half and the Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel and replacing it with an expansion and a new hotel to replace the Sheraton[3]. An arena was ultimately determined to be unfeasible due to "significant operational and construction related challenges."[3] As a result of the Phase 1 recommendation, the Mayor of Baltimore requested the Maryland Stadium Authority to start Phase 2 which the MSA approved in July 2018[4]. Phase 2 started in fall 2018 and will "outline preliminary design, cost estimating (construction and projects), and financing modeling."[4]
