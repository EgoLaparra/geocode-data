It connects with the Xi'an–Baoji high-speed railway to the east and the Lanzhou–Urumqi high-speed railway to the west.
The feasibility study report has been approved by the National Development and Reform Commission. The construction work was expected to start in the first half of 2011,[2] but it actually started in October 2012.[1][3][4] The line started operations on July 9, 2017.[5]

The dam was constructed for hydroelectric power generation, flood control and water supply for irrigation and industrial uses. The 132 m (433 ft) tall concrete gravity dam creates a 2,550,000,000 m3 (2,067,319 acre⋅ft) reservoir with a surface area of 61.2 km2 (24 sq mi).

Below the left intermediate opening are two bottom sluices. The total discharge capacity of the spillways and openings is 16,060 m3/s (567,154 cu ft/s). The dam's power station contains 4 x 175 MW Francis turbine-generators which are afford a maximum hydraulic head of 103 m (338 ft) given the dam's height.[2][3][4]

The Wabanaki seasonally fished, hunted and gathered berries, clams, and other shellfish in the area seasonally. They spoke of Bar Harbor as Man-es-ayd'ik ("clam-gathering place") or Ah-bays'auk ("clambake place"), leaving great piles of shells as evidence of this abundance.

The town has a picturesque market square with a large church. There are few shops and no hotels. The area economy is based on subsistence agriculture, although a small association of subsistence farmers, Kafe Devlopman Barade, began exporting coffee to the U.S. in 2008. The town is vulnerable to flooding and is accessible via a rocky dirt road. The road is periodically improved, but remains passable only by lorries or high-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicles. Baradères is also accessible by boat from Petite Trou de Nippes, but sedimentation has made the Bay of Baradères very shallow in places and difficult to navigate—even by canoe.  The river mouth is increasingly being blocked by sediment. This sediment is a result of severe soil erosion upstream. Primary causes of the erosion probably are riverbank scouring during heavy rainstorms, along with deforestation and cropping of hillsides in the Baradères River valley.

Baranów belonged to the Baranowski family, and in the late 15th century it became property of the Kurozwecki family. In 1518 Barbara Kurozwecka married Stanisław Górka, so Baranów remained in the hands of the Górka family until 1560, when it was sold to Rafał Leszczyński. During the Protestant Reformation, Baranów was an important center of Calvinism. The town prospered due to grain trade, as well as its artisans. Its decline began during the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660), when Baranów was ransacked and burned.

The accumulation of iron debris covered the entire area of Baratti overlooking the sea, allowing rare archaeological insight into the area's heritage. The first archaeological expeditions resulted in impressive discoveries preserved in the area. In 1968, a 6th-century silver vase, or anfora, from Antioch and lost in a shipwreck was found off the gulf.
