Due to the nature of the tramway's construction, the cars can stop and drop off almost anywhere and will do so within reason.  For this reason a great number of localised stopping places have built up since the line was completed, many at the intersection of farmer's crossings like this one.  The crossings/halts usually take the name of the farmer or the farm as is the case here, but these unofficial halts never appear in timetable materials or have nameboards fitted to show their names.  Many do however now carry bus stop-type signs attached to traction poles, and these were fitted in line with then-management policy in 1999.

The entrance, with a double towered gate, is in the north wall and had twin D-shaped towers. It has a gatehouse typical of the period, the outer portions of which have almost completely disappeared. The castle, however, remains an impressive structure. The interior measures about 30 square metres (320 sq ft). There are three-quarter round towers at all four corners and also in the middle of the east and west walls.[2]  A postern gate, which was planned for the centre of the south wall, was never completed, probably because of the events of 1317, when the castle was lost to the O'Connors. A small square tower had protected this gate. </p>

The Center is a municipal building owned and operated by the City of Baltimore. The facility was constructed in two separate phases: the original Center, with 425,000 square feet (39,500 m2) of exhibition and meeting space, opened in August 1979 at a cost of $51.4 million. A $151 million expansion, which increased the Center's total size to 1,225,000 square feet (113,800 m2) was completed in April 1997.[1] The 752-room, city-owned <link wikipedia="Hilton_Baltimore" osm="7021530" type="relation">Hilton Baltimore</link> hotel opened in August 2008, connected to the convention center by an enclosed skywalk bridge. Another expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center has been proposed at an estimated cost of $400 million that includes a new 500 room hotel and an 18,500 seat arena; this project is estimated to cost $900 million, this proposal is no longer active and considered dead. As of March 2016, the State of Maryland is going to explore expanding the Baltimore Convention Center for an estimated cost of $600 million and build a new hotel attached to the expansion. As of August 2016, the proposal of having a combined expanded convention center, arena and hotel has been revived. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake requested a $1 million feasibility study from the Maryland Stadium Authority which was approved on August 2, 2016. As of September 2017, Phase 1 of the feasibility study has begun with the release expected to be sometime by the end of 2017[2]. On July 6, 2018, the Maryland Stadium Authority finally released Phase 1 of the feasibility study. Phase 1 gives the ultimate recommendation of demolishing the 1979 eastern half and the Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel and replacing it with an expansion and a new hotel to replace the Sheraton[3]. An arena was ultimately determined to be unfeasible due to "significant operational and construction related challenges."[3] As a result of the Phase 1 recommendation, the Mayor of Baltimore requested the Maryland Stadium Authority to start Phase 2 which the MSA approved in July 2018[4]. Phase 2 started in fall 2018 and will "outline preliminary design, cost estimating (construction and projects), and financing modeling."[4]

There are two natural limestone karst tunnel out of the village, the villagers have to go inside or outside through a few kilometers by boat. Due to its remoteness position so it is difficult to contact with the outside world,. Bamei is isolated with the outside world, which is known as” the land of idyllic beauty”.
Because of its isolation, the villagers still used ancient farming tools just as wooden plow harrow and homemade water tankers. They produce clothes from own cotton, make fire to cook, live a self-sufficiency life.
The population of Bamei is very small. In the 1950s, there were only more than 30 households.

      <p id="GL039_433_002" num_links="2">Villagers had uncovered some of the pottery in prior years without insight into their age or historical importance. In August 1966, Steve Young, a political science student at Harvard College, was living in the village conducting interviews for his senior honors thesis. Young, a speaker of Thai, was familiar with the work of Wilhelm G. Solheim and his theory of possible ancient origins of civilization in Southeast Asia. One day while walking down a path in Ban Chiang with his assistant, an art teacher at the village school, Young tripped over a root of a kapok tree and fell on his face in the dirt path. Under him were the exposed tops of small and medium-sized pottery jars. Young recognized that the firing techniques used to make the pots were very rudimentary, but that the designs applied to the surface of the vessels were unique. He took samples of pots to Princess Phanthip Chumbote who had the private museum of <link wikipedia="Suan_Pakkad_Palace" osm="230891857" type="way">Suan Pakkad</link> in Bangkok and to Chin Yu Di of the Thai Government's Fine Arts Department.[1] Later, Elisabeth Lyons, an art historian on the staff of the <link wikipedia="Ford_Foundation" osm="265517922" type="way">Ford Foundation</link>, sent sherds from Ban Chiang to the University of Pennsylvania for dating.[2]
