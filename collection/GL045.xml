By the 13th century, Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and count of Luxemburg, was minting coins in Bastogne. In 1332, John the Blind, his son, granted the city its charter and had it encircled by defensive walls, part of which, the current Porte de Trèves, still exists. In 1451, the lands of the county of Luxemburg were absorbed into the Duchy of Burgundy and as a result, Bastogne became part of the lands of the Spanish Crown when the Burgundian heir Charles became king of <link wikipedia="Spain" osm="148332300 1311341" type="node relation">Spain</link> in 1516.

Anchored by the Historic Quad, the campus of Bates totals 813 acres (329 ha) with a small urban campus which includes 33 Victorian Houses as some of the dormitories. It maintains 600 acres (240 ha) of nature preserve known as the "Bates-Morse Mountain" near Campbell Island and a coastal center on <link wikipedia="Kennebec_River" osm="5199133" type="relation">Atkins Bay</link>. With an annual enrollment of approximately 1,800 students, it is the smallest college in its athletic conference. As a result of its small student body, Bates retains selective admission rates and little to no transfer percentages. The nominal cost of attendance is considered very high with tuition frequently among the most expensive in the United States.

      <p id="GL045_140_002" num_links="2">The college was founded on March 16, 1855, by abolitionist statesman Oren Burbank Cheney and textile tycoon Benjamin Bates. Established as the Maine State Seminary, the college became the first coeducational college in New England and went on to confer the first female undergraduate degree in the area. Bates is the third-oldest college in Maine, succeeding <link wikipedia="Bowdoin_College" osm="279021849" type="way">Bowdoin</link> and <link wikipedia="Colby_College" osm="39754167" type="way">Colby College</link>. It became a vanguard in admitting minority students before the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation. During early 1900s the college began to aggressively expand and by the mid-1940s, amassed large amounts of property, becoming a major economic power in Lewiston. Since the 1950s, the college has acquired and attempted to remedy a reputation for educating the affluent of New England. Improvements to its reputation were diminished after large losses during the 2008 financial crisis increased its tuition costs. The late 2010s saw a redoubled push for socioeconomic, racial, and cultural diversity as well as a major expansion of student financial aid.

      <p id="GL045_147_001" num_links="2">Batesville was founded as Oliver's Store sometime around 1760 at the crossroads of two existing roads.  By 1829, the name of the settlement was changed to Mount Israel, as indicated by United States Post Office records.  The settlement's current name, Batesville, came into use by 1835, in reference to the Bates family.[3]  Batesville's position at the intersection of two roads helped to develop the community as a way-station and repair point.  The community's development was spurred by the completion of the  Staunton and James River Turnpike, which was authorized by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1818 and began construction in 1826.[4][5]  This turnpike connected the fertile farmlands of the Shenandoah Valley near <link wikipedia="Staunton,_Virginia" osm="157572900 206646 3864617" type="node relation relation">Staunton</link> to <link wikipedia="Scottsville,_Virginia" osm="207017" type="relation">Scottsville</link> on the James River, a distance of 43.5 miles (70.0 km).  Batesville, which was located at the halfway point on the turnpike, saw an increase in traffic through the community as farmers took advantage of the new road to carry agricultural products to eastern markets.  The barrel industry became one of the community's foremost industries as well as stagecoach repair.[5]

The architect of the complex is said to be Apollodorus of Damascus.[1] The baths were being utilized mainly as a recreational and social center by Roman citizens, both men and women, as late as the early 5th century.[2] The complex seems to have been deserted soon afterwards as a cemetery dated to the 5th century (which remained in use until the 7th century) has been found in front of the northeastern exedra.[3] The baths were thus no longer in use at the time of the siege of Rome by the Ostrogoths in 537; with the destruction of the Roman aqueducts, all thermae were abandoned, as was the whole of the now-waterless Mons Oppius[4]. Early Christian writers misnamed the remains the 'Baths of Domitian'.[5]

Succeeding two previous chapel buildings on Yale's Old Campus, it provided space for daily chapel services, which were mandatory for Yale College students until 1926. Together with Durfee Hall and Farnam Hall, the chapel was part of a program begun in the 1870s to build up the perimeter of Old Campus and separate it from the rest of the city. These three buildings, all by the same architect, were among the first at Yale to be named for donors rather than function, location, or legislative funding.

It was built in 1768 for Colonel John Banister (1734–1788), the first mayor of Petersburg, a colonel of cavalry in the Revolutionary War, member of the Virginia House of Burgesses delegate to the Continental Congress, and signer of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, Virginia State Constitution, and the Articles of Confederation.  It is a symmetrical five-part Palladian house consisting of a two-story central block topped by a pyramidal roof, one-story wings that act as hyphens, and 1 1/2-story end pavilions. Although modeled in the Palladian style, its unique character is adapted to a colonial American lifestyle.  Battersea is similar in design to the Palladian mansion at Lower Brandon Plantation in nearby <link wikipedia="Prince_George_County,_Virginia" osm="2534200" type="relation">Prince George</link>, also completed in the 1760s and perhaps designed by <link wikipedia="Thomas_Jefferson" osm="2507619" type="relation">Thomas Jefferson</link>.  Although the designer of Battersea remains a mystery, he would have been conversant in European tastes of the day. Also on the property are the contributing greenhouse and a kitchen, which may have additionally served as a laundry and servants’ quarter. The brick greenhouse, or orangerie, is significant for its rarity and design. Built between 1825-1835, it is almost 190 years old and remains one of the few of its kind still in existence.  The ruins of Bannister's Mill, a gristmill built in 1732, are located nearby on land that was part of Battersea plantation in the 18th century.

The facilities built for the sanitarium are in an architecturally distinctive Romanesque and Mission Revival style, and now form the centerpiece of the Black Hills Health Care facility, operated by the VA.
