In clear weather it is also visible from Smyril M/F just before she enters the fjord of Trongisvágur, Trongisvágsfjørður. Men from Sumba used to rappel down the steep mountain side of Beinisvørð on bird lines (it is called "síging"; one man hangs on a thick rope, while several men hold it at the top) in order to catch sea birds and to collect eggs. Both birds and their eggs were important food for the people of Sumba in the past. Several men have been killed while doing this; sometimes a stone fell on a man's head, fatally injuring him. In 1975 a big avalanche at Beinisvørð destroyed numerous bird habitats and landmarks.[2]

The original idea was to incorporate it in a complex of government ministries, but the state's third president, Zalman Shazar, who was very much a man of the people, wanted to live in a residential area and not in splendid isolation, and persuaded the government.[1] As a result, they approved the construction of a permanent presidential residence on a 10-dunam plot in Talbiya.[2] A competition for the architectural design was launched in 1964 and limited to Israeli architects.[1] Of some 200 entries, the design submitted by Jerusalemite architect Abba Elhanani was selected.[2] Beit HaNassi was inaugurated in 1971 by President Shazar.[1][2] The designs came under harsh criticism from different public figures.[2]
