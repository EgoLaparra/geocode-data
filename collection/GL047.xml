The upper platform of the plateau is marked with carved round holes, trails, niches and steps that some researches interpret as stellar map[citation needed]. It is claimed by some Bulgarian media that in 2006, anonymous tourists had discovered the so-called "Inscription of Belintash" - a petroglyph carved into the rocks, which according to some theorists, confirm that the Thracians had their own alphabet that pre-dates Greek alphabet[citation needed].

      <p id="GL047_109_001" num_links="2">The earliest St. Louis telephone exchange was located in the National Bank Building at 417 Olive (since demolished) in 1878.[1] By the late 1880s, space for a dedicated telephone exchange facility was needed. Groundbreaking occurred in 1889 after the acceptance of the <link wikipedia="Boston" osm="158809705 2315704" type="node relation">Boston</link>-based Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge design, and the final construction cost was $154,225.[1] The main switchboard room was at the top of the building (then only six stories). Between 1890 and 1910 telephone use expanded dramatically, and the local St. Louis Bell Company merged with other Bell telephone companies to form Southwestern Bell by 1920. In 1923, Southwestern Bell absorbed the local St. Louis telephone competitor, Kinloch Telephone, adding to pressure on the capacity of the building. These pressures resulted in the construction of the nearby <link wikipedia="Southwestern_Bell_Building" osm="108706678" type="way">Southwestern Bell Building</link> in St. Louis between 1923 and 1926.

She was the oldest of five siblings of a wealthy family. Her grandfather Sotiris Papasotiriou, after whom she was named and who was particularly fond of her, was an Orthodox priest at Shimatari. As a little girl, Sotiria would go to church along with her grandfather and she would absorb the religious sounds and Byzantine hymns. She began singing at the age of three, and was soon making her own guitars out of wire and wood and playing them. Her father, Kyriakos Bellos, had a grocery store in Neapolis in the northern part of Chalkida. The movie "The little emigree" (I prosphygopoula) featuring the popular singer Sofia Vembo was the catalyst that pushed her to pursue an artistic career. On hearing of her daughter's ambitions, her mother Eleni beat her because, as a conservative woman of that time, she did not want her daughter to pursue an artistic career. However, her father bought her a guitar and paid for private lessons.[4]

William Barton, a native of <link wikipedia="Bloomfield,_Connecticut" osm="158863474 5970033" type="node relation">Bloomfield, Connecticut</link>, arrived in East Hampton in 1807, bringing with him the specialized knowledge of working brass for the manufacture of bells.  He established a foundry, where he trained a whole generation of bellmakers whose work would fuel the town's economy.  The Bevin Brothers, among those he trained, were the first to apply water power to the process, damming Pocotopaug Brook for the purpose.  Their business continues to be a major presence in the town.  By 1860, Belltown had 23 men listed as bell manufacturers.[2]
