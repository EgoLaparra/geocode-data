The former Mollington Street Rail Depot was branched into the line. A section of the line runs through Haymarket Tunnel and a low-level cutting through the centre of Birkenhead; visible from the road flyovers. The former Canning Street North signal box has now been demolished following fire damage, and the rails across the level crossing there have been removed due to the provision of cycle lanes on the roadway. The non-standard gates remain on the east side, but a fence has been erected on the other side despite the railway being officially out of use, rather than closed. Level crossings are also located at Duke Street and Wallasey Bridge Road. The railway lines are still partially intact.

The electrification of the main line from London to New Street in the 1960s saw New Street favoured over Snow Hill, which saw most of its services withdrawn in the late 1960s. This led to the station's eventual closure in 1972, and demolition five years later. After fifteen years of closure a new Snow Hill station, the present incarnation, was built; it reopened in 1987.

The current route of the river seems to date back to the ninth century and is characterized by a sharp turn to the south that leads the river to flow near the southern edge of the mountains of Calvana. These mountains are mostly bare and stony, and form an arc from north to south. The water transported from Bisenzio has a very important role that balances the progressive lowering of the bottom of the lake basin.

Both the cathedral and the Bishop's House were built in the neo-Gothic style. The granite foundation of Bishop's House was quarried in Northern Montana and transported down the Columbia River.
