This resulted in an influx of settlers, and this area of western lesser Poland, located near the border with Czech-ruled Silesia, emerged as a center of industry, with several forges and bloomeries. In the 16th century, when the settlement of Łojki (future Blachownia) belonged to Kraków Voivodeship, it had as many as 36 forges, powered by water wheels. Furthermore, iron ore was excavated here, and in one of the still-existing documents from 1531, King <link wikipedia="Sigismund_II_Augustus" osm="2519710" type="relation">Zygmunt August</link> allowed a man named Błazej Łojek to run a forge.

The canyon's name owes itself to the fact that parts of the gorge only receive 33 minutes of sunlight a day, according to Images of America: The Black Canyon of the Gunnison. In the book, author Duane Vandenbusche states, "Several canyons of the American West are longer and some are deeper, but none combines the depth, sheerness, narrowness, darkness, and dread of the Black Canyon."[3]

The greatest descent of the Gunnison River occurs within the park at Chasm View dropping 240 feet per mile (45 m/km).[4]  The Black Canyon is so named because its steepness makes it difficult for sunlight to penetrate into its depths. As a result, the canyon is often shrouded in shadow, causing the rocky walls to appear black. At its narrowest point the canyon is only 40 ft (12 m) wide at the river.[4][5]

Origins of the community trace back to 1862 when it was settled by American Civil War veteran, Thomas J. Burdick and his son, Abraham.

Today, Black Creek hosts a variety of community events including the annual Family Daze celebration.

It is therefore an important representation of typical coastal plain ecosystems that existed before forests were cleared[2] and the rivers dammed. The Pascagoula River is nationally significant as one of the largest unimpeded rivers remaining in the lower 48 states.[3]  Rare species include the Pearl darter and the Yellow-blotched map turtle, both found only in this river and its tributaries. This wilderness area is surrounded by De Soto National Forest, which is also one of the nation's most important areas of coastal plain ecosystems.[4]

Between Clear Lake and Saline Lake is the Alan Chiverly Dam, constructed in 1934. Road 1226 also extends between the lakes.[4] The full area of the lake is 13,500 acres. Black Lake itself is shallow so in cold temperatures the fish head to Clear Lake and continue on towards Black Bayou as the weather gets colder so that in colder months the fish can be found only in deeper waters. Most of the crappie found at Black Lake are black crappie.[5]

There is a suggestion too that the names Hatterrall Hill and Mynydd y Gader may also once have been used to apply to the entire range of the Black Mountains though the former later became confined to the vicinity of its eastern ridge. The latter is now recognised in Pen y Gader-fawr (Pen y Gadair Fawr) and Gader Fawr (Gadair Fawr); names applied to the hill at SO 229288. Cadair, mutated to 'gadair' and anglicised as 'gader', means 'seat' or 'chair' in Welsh.[1]

A storm destroyed the tower in 1821 and the current, stone lighthouse was erected in its place in 1823. The Black Rock Harbor Light was an active navigational aid until 1933 when it was replaced by two automatic lights offshore. The beacon was subsequently given to the City of Bridgeport in 1934.  Two significant efforts during the 1980s and 1990s served to restore the aging tower and the light was relit as a non-navigational aid in 2000.

of spring stems from moderately-deep circulation[1] and emerges from a water-filled limestone cave in a 
steep cliff. From the mouth of the cave, the water is funneled to flow 
out of the mouths of three ornamental stone-carved tiger heads into a 
square-shaped spring pool. From there it runs into the old city moat, 
next to which the spring is located. According to the tradition, there 
was a black rock lying in front of the cave in ancient time.[2] The name of the spring is 
said to be derived from the shape and color of the rock, which 
resembled a black tiger, and the sound of the water gushing past the 
rock being reminiscent of the roar of a tiger. The ancient layout of 
the spring is described in a poem by the Ming Dynasty poet, Yan

It is unique in being an example of a permanent village on the plains: an area associated with nomadic hunting.  The crossing became an important place in Canadian history when Treaty 7 was signed here between the native nations of what is now southern Alberta and the Canadian government on behalf of the Crown in 1877.  It was also here that Crowfoot, chief of the Siksika, is believed to have died and been buried.  As well, Poundmaker, a chief of the Cree who had been ceremonially adopted by Crowfoot in order to create peace between the Blackfoot and the Cree, was also buried here until being moved in 1967.  In 1925 the traditional gathering site and the treaty signing site were declared National Historic Sites of Canada by the federal government's Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.[1]  In 1972, the earthlodge village was also declared a national historic site.[2]
