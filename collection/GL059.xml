The small mining town was established on the west side of Peshastin Creek in the foothills of the Wenatchee Mountains in the mid-1870s.  The first mining claims were filed in 1874, and a stamp mill followed by 1878.  A wagon road to <link wikipedia="Cle_Elum,_Washington" osm="238090" type="relation">Cle Elum</link> was completed in 1879.  The community was originally called Werner with the establishment of a post office in 1893, but the name was changed to Blewett a year later.  It was named after Edward Blewett of <link wikipedia="Seattle" osm="29546940 237385" type="node relation">Seattle</link>, whose mining company owned many of the claims in the area.  A road to Peshastin was completed in 1896, and a stage ran three days a week.  During this time the town boasted a school, a two-story hotel, stores, a saloon and telegraph service.  The mill ceased operations in 1905 when the main vein of ore ran out.  Not much exists there today, though the Stamp Mill and scattered small buildings are still standing.  A few mines are still accessible, but care must be taken when exploring.

That they played in Blokker was due to Ben Essing, the son of the mayor. Essing had also managed to get other acts to play in the Blokker auction hall, and organized a "Dutch Teener Fest" in 1964 and 1965, which made international headlines.[1]

The plant is unique in the fact that rather than burning fuels, such as coal or natural gas to drive the production process, waste heat from electrical generation at the Coal Creek Station is used.[1]  The US$100 million plant is capable of processing 18 million bushels (460,000 metric tons) of corn to produce 50 million gallons  (190 million liters) of ethanol each year, and is estimated to have a net annual economic impact of $160 million on the North Dakota economy,[2] as well as the creation of approximately 40 new jobs to run the plant.[3]  In addition to producing ethanol the plant will also produce dry distillers grains, a byproduct of the distillation process which is used as animal feed.[3]  Of the 18 million bushels of corn used each year for feedstock, the majority will be grown in southeast North Dakota and brought in via rail, with the remaining one third being produced locally.[4]  In 2006 the Blue Flint Ethanol project was awarded the Project of the Year Award by Governor John Hoeven.

The lake is man-made, the result of sluicing operations that began in 1873 when John Ewing (1844–1922) formed the St.Bathans Channel Company, to mine the Kildare Hill Gold Claim in St Bathans. His company constructed a tailings channel and introduced hydraulic elevating to work the claim. As this work progressed the Kildare Hill Claim became the site of the deepest hydraulic elevating operation in the world, that would turn a 120-metre hill into a 68-metre hole. Work stopped in 1902 when there was insufficient fall in the tailings channel to carry away the tailings. By 1905 John Ewing was bankrupt as a result of poor investments in other locations. The Kildare Hill Claim was then taken up by the Scandinavian Water Race Company in that year. This company restarted operations and worked the claim until 1932, when it was finally abandoned due to the fear of undermining the town of St Bathans. Natural drainage from the surrounding hills filled the hole with water and created the present day lake. The Blue Lake is a key feature of modern-day St. Bathans and is used for swimming, fishing, bodyboarding, and kayaking.

When it was built this was the <link wikipedia="Molonglo_River" osm="9789542" type="relation">Molonglo River</link> floodplain. It was built by George P. Campbell in about 1858 for his ploughman William Ginn.[1]  Ginn lived there with his family until 1874 and then Flora and George Blundell moved in and remained there until about 1933.[1] Flora was a midwife and George a bullock driver for Campbell.  In 1913 the Duntroon estate was acquired by the Commonwealth to form part of the new Federal Capital Territory, although the Blundells continued to live there. Then Harry and Alice Oldfield moved to the cottage in 1933.

Calloway made preliminary surveys and filed land claims under the Swamp Land Act of 1850.

On July 17, 1877, Blythe filed his first claim for Colorado River water on what was to become the "Blythe Intake".[8][9][10][11] Blythe appointed another man named George Irish as manager to assist Calloway in building an irrigation system. Calloway died in a Chemehuevi attack on March 28, 1880, and was replaced by C.C. Miller, the father of Frank Augustus Miller.[12][13] Thomas Blythe died on April 4, 1883; his only revisit to the valley was in November 1882.[13][14] After his death, the work in the valley halted and Blythe's estate subsequently went into litigation between his illegitimate daughter Florence and other claimants, the trial beginning in 1889. In the 1900s, Florence was awarded the estate, after several years of preceding rulings in favor of her and appeals against her.[9][13][15]
