The four institutes of the BRC employ about 260 scientists, whose work is used in international scientific publications and patents. Research topics include several fields of molecular and cell biology: from the industrial use of bacteria, through controlled improvement of cultivated plants, to human health and environmental protection. The BRC is primarily a scientific research centre; however, scientists at the BRC play a role in the foundation and promotion of biotechnological companies and education. The activities and scientific research pursued at the BRC have been acknowledged by the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO); in 2000, the BRC was awarded the title of "Centre of Excellence of the European Union"  by the <link wikipedia="European_Union" osm="2668952" type="relation">EU</link>.

The former Mollington Street Rail Depot was branched into the line. A section of the line runs through Haymarket Tunnel and a low-level cutting through the centre of Birkenhead; visible from the road flyovers. The former Canning Street North signal box has now been demolished following fire damage, and the rails across the level crossing there have been removed due to the provision of cycle lanes on the roadway. The non-standard gates remain on the east side, but a fence has been erected on the other side despite the railway being officially out of use, rather than closed. Level crossings are also located at Duke Street and Wallasey Bridge Road. The railway lines are still partially intact.

The electrification of the main line from London to New Street in the 1960s saw New Street favoured over Snow Hill, which saw most of its services withdrawn in the late 1960s. This led to the station's eventual closure in 1972, and demolition five years later. After fifteen years of closure a new Snow Hill station, the present incarnation, was built; it reopened in 1987.

      <p id="GL060_377_002" num_links="2">The river is a tributary of the Arno arising from the southern side of the Tuscan-Emilian Appennines. Its source is generally located at the confluence of the Trogola and Bacuccio. The length of its path reaches 49 km. The upper basin is surrounded by many mountains and  is surrounded by lower peaks on the east, bordering the <link wikipedia="Sieve_(river)" osm="2573985" type="relation">Sieve</link> and the upper area of Prato Marinella.

The current route of the river seems to date back to the ninth century and is characterized by a sharp turn to the south that leads the river to flow near the southern edge of the mountains of Calvana. These mountains are mostly bare and stony, and form an arc from north to south. The water transported from Bisenzio has a very important role that balances the progressive lowering of the bottom of the lake basin.

By the Iron Age we have our first evidence for burials in the parish- at least six graves were found in a small cave. A small glass bead decorated with white spiral patterns may also have come from an early or middle Iron Age grave, though it may have been lost in another way.
