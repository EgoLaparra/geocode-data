The first lighthouse at the site, built by Abisha Woodward under contract with the United States government, was a wooden tower that was lit and made operational by 1808. A storm destroyed the tower in 1821 and the current, stone lighthouse was erected in its place in 1823. The Black Rock Harbor Light was an active navigational aid until 1933 when it was replaced by two automatic lights offshore. The beacon was subsequently given to the City of Bridgeport in 1934.  Two significant efforts during the 1980s and 1990s served to restore the aging tower and the light was relit as a non-navigational aid in 2000.  Black Rock Lighthouse is listed as a contributing property for Bridgeport's Seaside Park historic district.

of spring stems from moderately-deep circulation[1] and emerges from a water-filled limestone cave in a 
steep cliff. From the mouth of the cave, the water is funneled to flow 
out of the mouths of three ornamental stone-carved tiger heads into a 
square-shaped spring pool. From there it runs into the old city moat, 
next to which the spring is located. According to the tradition, there 
was a black rock lying in front of the cave in ancient time.[2] The name of the spring is 
said to be derived from the shape and color of the rock, which 
resembled a black tiger, and the sound of the water gushing past the 
rock being reminiscent of the roar of a tiger. The ancient layout of 
the spring is described in a poem by the Ming Dynasty poet, Yan 
Bizeng.[2]

Nearby are the remains of an ancient earthlodge village, believed to have been built by people from the Upper Mississippi valley in what is now the United States.  It is unique in being an example of a permanent village on the plains: an area associated with nomadic hunting.  The crossing became an important place in Canadian history when Treaty 7 was signed here between the native nations of what is now southern Alberta and the Canadian government on behalf of the Crown in 1877.  It was also here that Crowfoot, chief of the Siksika, is believed to have died and been buried.  As well, Poundmaker, a chief of the Cree who had been ceremonially adopted by Crowfoot in order to create peace between the Blackfoot and the Cree, was also buried here until being moved in 1967.  In 1925 the traditional gathering site and the treaty signing site were declared National Historic Sites of Canada by the federal government's Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.[1]  In 1972, the earthlodge village was also declared a national historic site.[2]

A north–south route crosses the county, and intersects with a second railroad line that connects Hartford City with communities to the west.[9]

The village is dominated by the Church of St. Margaret of Antioch, erected in 1858 on the site of an earlier Anglican Chapel which was attached to the Church of St. Helen at nearby Ashby-de-la-Zouch. The church stands in an elevated position next to the village school, and is built in the early English style.[1] The church has a nave and chancel, with a tower surmounted by a broach spire and, for the greater part of the work, constructed from local sandstone which has become blackened due to the effects of air pollution.

The library was envisioned in 1999 and designated the Blair-Caldwell African American Research Library in honor of Omar Blair, the first black president of the <link wikipedia="Denver" osm="1411339" type="relation">Denver</link> school board, and Elvin Caldwell, the first black city council member.

Blanchard Springs Caverns is a three-level cave system, all of which can be viewed on guided tours. 
The Dripstone Trail runs through the uppermost level of caverns for about a half-mile and opened in 1973.[2] The Discovery Trail opened in 1977 and loops through a 1.2-mile section of the cavern, descending to the lower level of the cave, 366 feet underground, as well as to the Natural Entrance, about 100 feet below ground at that point, following the stream bed of the springs that created the cavern. This trail includes the Rimstone Dams, which create pools along the stream bed, and the Ghost Room, a small but very well decorated room in the uppermost level, with its huge white flowstone. Also offered is a "Wild Cave" tour which allows access to undeveloped parts of the cave to more adventurous visitors. It follows the upstream section of the cave, allowing visitors to see all three levels as the original explorers did, continuing beyond where the Discovery Trail ends.
