Consisting of just two through platforms it had no sidings for working local goods traffic, which was the normal scenario in rural East Anglia.[3] The station buildings on the up platform were particularly splendid for a very small station and were captured by the well known and popular transport artist Malcolm Root FGRA.[4] The facilities on the down platform were very modest by comparison. 
The station had a very restricted catchment area and with a local population of just 730 in 1901 and  811 in  1961, passenger numbers were always very limited.[5]
A level crossing at the west end of the station was controlled by a signal box  on the up side with just 12 levers.[6]

It is a linear settlement located along the busy A272 trunk road which was widened by the American troops in 1943 in preparation for D-Day. [1]
The village itself is peculiar due to the large number of large houses dating from the Georgian period, a few of these are set in/next to beautiful rolling parkland with specimen trees.
[2] The Fox Inn, which is located just a short distance from the garage, is a thriving country pub- 17th century in origin, this cosy weather-boarded building has witnessed many historic events, for example the <link wikipedia="Battle_of_Cheriton" osm="2157190064" type="node">Battle of Cheriton</link> in the year 1644, when Sir William Waller and his troops marched through the village, it was during this time that many of the houses in the village were requisitioned for use of troops of both sides.
[3]
In the year 1823 a Roman villa was discovered in the parish. It was found to have contained two tesselated pavements of very fine qualities.
[4] One of the main attractions of the village is Bramdean House with its beautiful mirror image herbaceous borders, it is open on particular days of the year and all proceeds go to the National Garden Scheme, it is also in this place that on one day each year the Bramdean Village Fete is held, it has become well known and is popular amongst people in the village and in the local area.

Public access is currently gained via the neighbouring convent, designed by Brunelleschi. The church and the chapel are treated as separate places to visit and as such have different opening times and it is quite difficult to see the rest of the church from the chapel.

The area had served as an Army training ground during the American Civil War. At the time, the northern portion of the area had been a marsh known as Old Blue Jay Swamp. In 1898, a public appropriation financed the conversion of the swamp into a landscaped lake.  The initial park was only 60 acres (24 ha) in size but grew in the 1920s through private donations from prominent Newark families, such as the Ballantines, eventually reaching the city limit with <link wikipedia="Belleville,_New_Jersey" osm="158842773 170773" type="node relation">Belleville</link> and becoming one of the largest urban parks in the United States.

However, most of Brandhall was developed in the 1950s and 1960s, when several thousand council houses, flats and bungalows were built by Oldbury Council. Some of the high-rise flats in Brandhall have recently been demolished and in their place housing associations have built new low-rise homes. Brandhall is growing to be a more popular place due to the construction of new facilities, such as a local supermarket and a doctor's surgery.

Syrmia, and hence Braničevo, came to be contested between Kingdom of Hungary on the one side, and the Byzantine Empire and the Second Bulgarian Empire (after its independence from the Byzantines) on the other. In the 13th century the Hungarians established the Banate of Braničevo (Banovina of Braničevo), but later in the century two local Bulgarian rulers, Darman and Kudelin, became independent and ruled over Braničevo and Kučevo. In 1291, they were defeated by the Serbian king, Stefan Dragutin, who joined Braničevo to his Syrmian Kingdom. Under his rule the town of Braničevo became a seat of the Eparchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church.[2] The region later belonged to subsequent Serbian states, until it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. In the 14th century, the region was in a possession of local rulers from the House of Rastislalić. During the Ottoman rule, Braničevo was part of the Sanjak of Smederevo, and since 19th century, it is again part of the <link wikipedia="Serbia" osm="369137525 1741311 9088937" type="node relation relation">Serbian</link> state.

parallel to, and south of, the Wrynose Pass road. Before flowing into 
Little Langdale Tarn it subsumes Bleamoss Beck, the outflow from <link wikipedia="Little_Langdale" osm="659781030" type="way">Blea Tarn</link>. Little Langdale Tarn is also replenished by the Greenburn Beck. The Brathay drains Little Langdale Tarn at its eastern side. It continues in an easterly direction, over Colwith Force where it falls 40 feet (12 m), before turning north and flowing into the tarn of <link wikipedia="Elter_Water" osm="336078" type="relation">Elter Water</link> at an elevation of 187 feet (57 m) above sea level.
