Proposed with the release of the Southern Transport Investment Program in 2007, the $79 million facility was constructed to replace an inner city, outdated and undersized Intermodal terminal - The Hobart Railyards. The Inland port was constructed in conjunction with the nearby Brighton Bypass from 2011[1][2]
The Bridgewater Industrial Estate was chosen as the preferred site of the Inland port because of its close proximity with the Midland Highway and the southern Railway line of the state. The Transport Hub allows freight to be easily transferred between road and rail transport and enable efficient movement of freight between Tasmania's southern and northern ports and has the added benefit of 250,000 fewer vehicle movements per year passing through the inner city.[3][4] The Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources first assessed the need for a southern transport hub ten years ago, but it was not until 2007 when the Southern Transport Investment Program was released that an official plan took shape.

These delays occur in addition to long travel times south of <link wikipedia="Bridgewater,_Tasmania" osm="252162456" type="node">Bridgewater</link>, where the main north/south railway line follows the <link wikipedia="River_Derwent_(Tasmania)" osm="2214146" type="relation">River Derwent</link> through Hobart's northern suburbs, across 21 level crossings which require slow train speeds to minimize the risk of accidents. The Macquarie Point site features a poor quality surface with uneven levels which creates difficulties for the loading, unloading and manoeuvring of freight across the site. The site configuration does not allow for efficient truck consolidation and deconsolidation and adds to the delays borne by transport companies waiting for containers to be unloaded.
Management and security is also difficult because of numerous entry points and the poor rail layout.

From 1997 to 2010 it was known as Bristol International Airport.[4] In 1997 a majority shareholding in the airport was sold to FirstGroup, and then in 2001 the airport was sold to a joint venture of Macquarie Bank and others. In September 2014, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan bought out Macquarie to become the sole owner.

</p>
      <p id="GL071_403_002" num_links="2">The site was occupied in the 19th century by the Old Fort of Nassau to protect the western entrance to the Nassau Harbour until it was demolished in 1873.[5] Long before the fort was built, the first settlement was established here in 1666, when Nassau was known as Charles town, which had developed in a haphazard manner lined with brothels and taverns visited by  pirates, cheats and vagabonds. The presence of pirates in the town caused attacks by Spaniards when the town people fled to American colonies. The town was rebuilt later with a fort and called Nassau, on the site now occupied by the Hotel. The town was attacked again in 1703 by the allied forces of the <link wikipedia="France" osm="11980 2202162" type="relation relation">French</link> and the <link wikipedia="Spain" osm="148332300 1311341" type="node relation">Spanish</link> who destroyed the fort. Piracy was decimated when the British Governor Woodes Rogers took over in 1718. Over the next two centuries, the town developed under American influence during the 18th and 19th  century witnessing glamour and many buildings of architectural excellence being built with slave labour. It was not until the Greeks came in the 20th century to man the sponging industry that rich started frequenting the island. Prohibition in USA encouraged at that time (1920 to 1933) the  GIs and tourist to visit the island for hooch. It was during this period that major hotels started coming up like the British Colonial Hotel and Fort Montagu, which initially operated for three months during the winter season till the Washington Ball was celebrated.[6]
