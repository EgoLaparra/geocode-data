As with the rest of the Harlem Line, the merger of New York Central with Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 transformed it into a Penn Central station, and then its service was gradually merged with the <link wikipedia="Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority" osm="2954773" type="relation">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</link>, and officially became part of Metro-North in 1983.

But in 1785 Brookfield petitioned, unsuccessfully, to be set off from Middleton. This was due to the division of the original town of Middleton into two parts by the long, high ridge of Moose Mountain, then a considerable obstacle to travel. Town meetings, traditionally held in the muddy season of March, were particularly difficult to attend for those beyond the ridge. In 1794, however, permission was granted, and Brookfield incorporated.

      <p id="GL073_102_002" num_links="3">The area of the neighborhood was inhabited by Clackamas people before settlement by whites. The first white settler in the area of was Giddeon Tibbets, who acquired the land in the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850. He settled the area in 1851, building a family home and grist mill. Tibbets named the area "Brookland" due to the river, creeks, and lakes on  his property. In 1868 Tibbets subdivided the property into smaller lots and allowed the Oregon Central Railroad to cross the property. The rail line and the subdivision quickly brought in a large number of residents to the neighborhood, which acquired its current name of "Brooklyn". The influx led to the construction of a town square at the corner of Powell Boulevard and Milwaukie Avenue. In the 1890s, the neighborhood received an influx of largely Roman Catholic <link wikipedia="Germany" osm="1683325355 51477 62781" type="node relation relation">German-Americans</link>.

By 1889 the works had grown to a large complex taking up  most of a city block. Following two fires, Poulson, whom had a background in  architecture and engineering, began experimenting with fire-proof design. The replacement building was innovative, combining non-combustible brick, plaster and iron in a single foundry structure built in 1892 and other buildings completed in 1896-97.[3] Throughout the main structure samples are found of the products made at Hecla. Staircases, fire escapes, manhole covers, street gratings, subway kiosks and the cast iron frameworks for elevators came from the Hecla Ironworks factory and were shipped by barge across the river from the Greenpoint Ave piers. The 133 iconic landmarked IRT subway entrances that were built for the opening of the 1904 NYC transit System were fashioned there and assembled in place on location.[4] Street lampposts, fences, balustrades, door facades, security gates and sidewalk clocks were all available by catalog. Many older buildings in NYC still have iron stairways and elevators created by Hecla that are still in use a century later. Until the advent of Terra-Cotta as a prime ornamental building material the industry was competitive with other ironwork factories supplying the trade from Brooklyn, manufacturing all manner of iron works for the building trades. While other landmarks like the <link wikipedia="Flatiron_Building" osm="264768896" type="way">Flatiron Building’s clock</link> gained landmark status much earlier in 1966, the façade on the foundry was the reason this factory building was nominated and gained landmark status in 2004. Hecla merged its foundry with a rival firm in 1913, the new firm was named Hecla-Winslow, Poulson gave ownership to a foundation which sold it in 1928 to the Carl H. Schultz Mineral Water company.

Brown bears usually congregate at the falls in July and early September, and many well-known photos of bears have been taken there. Bears in July are the greatest concentrations seen at any year at the falls; up to 25 bears have been seen at one time at Brooks Falls in that month.[2] In September, a smaller number of bears (maximum about 18 at one time) can be seen at the falls to feast on the later salmon runs. July and September are by far the best months for viewing grizzly bears in the Brooks Camp area.

It was designed by civil engineer Roy Peratrovich, Jr., the son of Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich, who were leaders in the ANB and counterpart Alaska Native Sisterhood.  Bronze plaques on the bridge refer to the Raven and Eagle clans of the Tlingit people.[3] The present bridge opened in 1965.  Previous bridges across the Mendenhall River, at or near the same spot, were constructed in 1903, 1919 and 1931.[4] The Brotherhood Bridge was slated for replacement, with widening and other improvements, in 2012. Demolition of the old bridge and construction of the new is currently pending.[5]

</p>
      <p id="GL073_356_002" num_links="2">The first part of the hill's name is a common Brythonic element meaning "breast, pap; hill-side, slope, breast (of hill)", which is frequent in Welsh placenames.[2] The Cornish historian and language expert Henry Jenner suggested that the name came from a corruption of the Cornish words bronn ughella/ewhella meaning "highest hill",[3] as it is the highest point of Bodmin Moor and of Cornwall.

More recently, toponymist Craig Weatherhill has put forward the alternative suggestion that it could be from 'Bronn Wennili' which translates as 'Hill of Swallows'. 
The name has evolved through a variety of historical spellings as follows: Brunwenely c.1200, 1239; Brown Wenely 1239; Brenwenelyn 1276; Bronwenely, Brunwely 1280; Brounwenely 1350, 1362; Broun Welyn 1386; Brounwenyly 1401; Brownwenelegh 1450, 1470; Brounwellye, Bronwelly 1576; Brown-wellye 1584; Brounwellie 1639; Menar Brownuello 1754.[4]
