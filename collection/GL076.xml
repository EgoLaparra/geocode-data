The pavilion was in the garden of William Balcombe, an English merchant who became a purveyor to Napoleon. His 14-year-old daughter Elizabeth Lucia ("Betsy") Balcombe was the only family member who spoke French and she became the family translator. Because of his family's closeness to Napoleon, Balcombe attracted the suspicion of Governor Hudson Lowe, and in 1818 he was forced to leave the island and return to England.[1] The Briars was then used as the home for the Admiral assigned to St Helena.[2]

In 1959 the Pavilion was purchased by Dame Mabel Brookes, a great granddaughter of William Balcombe, and donated it to the French government, which appointed her as Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 1960 in recognition of her generous gesture.[3] It became the third of the French properties on the island, together with his former tomb in Sane Valley and <link wikipedia="Longwood_House" osm="35798100 273908243" type="way way">Longwood House</link>.[4]

Bridgeport's offer to pay for the building of a courthouse and jail decided the matter. Bridgeport City Hall was constructed in 1853-54 between State and Bank Streets and cost $75,000. Alexander Jackson Davis designed it in the Greek Revival style to resemble a temple. The building, opened in 1855, had a large ground floor for use as City Hall, two floors for county government and court use and an auditorium, Washington Hall, for public gatherings. In 1886, when Bridgeport City Hall proved insufficient for both the growing needs of city and county, the Fairfield County Courthouse was built nearby.[4]

The original covered bridge was replaced by a truss bridge in 1933. The township originally contained several tiny hamlets, such as the aforementioned Upper Black Eddy, Narrowsville, and Rupletown[4].  Upper Black's Eddy, as it was originally called, and Raubsville were named for notable landholders, while Narrowsville was named for a particularly thin portion of the Delaware River.  With the construction of a centralized post office in Upper Black Eddy, the usage of separate names for the smaller towns ceased in an official capacity, and the everyday errands of residents became centered on the largest of the towns.  What little commercial trade exists in the township is now centered solely in Upper Black Eddy, with any evidence of there being any distinctive, smaller villages existing only on outdated road-signs and maps. Ringing Rocks Park is located within the township, as well as state game hunting lands.  Bridgeton Township is also home to the Homestead General Store, the oldest continually operating general store on the Delaware Canal.

By 1690, the community acquired a former malthouse and some adjoining land, which became their first permanent meeting house and a burial ground respectively.[2]  This stood near the junction of North Street and New Road, where the <link wikipedia="Studio_Theatre_(Brighton)" osm="104520964" type="way">Pavilion Theatre</link> now stands.[1]  When some pleasure gardens were laid out next to the meeting house in the 1790s, the community sold its grounds (known as Quaker's Croft and extending to 1 acre (0.40 ha))[1] to the <link wikipedia="George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom" osm="3962878" type="relation">Prince Regent</link>, and sold the building separately; it was immediately demolished by its new owner.  They used the £1,800 funds to buy a plot of land east of Ship Street for £1,000 and build a new meeting house, accessed by a narrow passageway next to two cottages which came with the land.[2][3]  It had an attached caretaker's cottage, and opened for worship in 1805.[3]  A large extension was added to the north in 1850;[1] and in 1876,[4] another extension was built to house educational facilities.  This is now used for various cultural activities as well.[5]

Proposed with the release of the Southern Transport Investment Program in 2007, the $79 million facility was constructed to replace an inner city, outdated and undersized Intermodal terminal - The Hobart Railyards. The Inland port was constructed in conjunction with the nearby Brighton Bypass from 2011[1][2]
The Bridgewater Industrial Estate was chosen as the preferred site of the Inland port because of its close proximity with the Midland Highway and the southern Railway line of the state. The Transport Hub allows freight to be easily transferred between road and rail transport and enable efficient movement of freight between Tasmania's southern and northern ports and has the added benefit of 250,000 fewer vehicle movements per year passing through the inner city.[3][4] The Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources first assessed the need for a southern transport hub ten years ago, but it was not until 2007 when the Southern Transport Investment Program was released that an official plan took shape.
