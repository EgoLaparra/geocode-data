</p>
      <p id="GL077_179_002" num_links="2">The site was occupied in the 19th century by the Old Fort of Nassau to protect the western entrance to the Nassau Harbour until it was demolished in 1873.[5] Long before the fort was built, the first settlement was established here in 1666, when Nassau was known as Charles town, which had developed in a haphazard manner lined with brothels and taverns visited by  pirates, cheats and vagabonds. The presence of pirates in the town caused attacks by Spaniards when the town people fled to American colonies. The town was rebuilt later with a fort and called Nassau, on the site now occupied by the Hotel. The town was attacked again in 1703 by the allied forces of the <link wikipedia="France" osm="11980 2202162" type="relation relation">French</link> and the <link wikipedia="Spain" osm="148332300 1311341" type="node relation">Spanish</link> who destroyed the fort. Piracy was decimated when the British Governor Woodes Rogers took over in 1718. Over the next two centuries, the town developed under American influence during the 18th and 19th  century witnessing glamour and many buildings of architectural excellence being built with slave labour. It was not until the Greeks came in the 20th century to man the sponging industry that rich started frequenting the island. Prohibition in USA encouraged at that time (1920 to 1933) the  GIs and tourist to visit the island for hooch. It was during this period that major hotels started coming up like the British Colonial Hotel and Fort Montagu, which initially operated for three months during the winter season till the Washington Ball was celebrated.[6]

The first bridge was a wooden structure completed in 1857, but washed away in a flood in 1859.  The second bridge was a four-span Pratt truss bridge built in 1887.  It spanned the northern industrial district that was developing on both sides of the river.  The 1887 bridge was very ornate, featuring finials on each top corner and a band of scrolls, crosses, and lines between them.  The horizontal struts and guard railings used X-shapes as a pattern.  In 1950, the bridge was raised 20 feet to allow barges and larger boats to pass underneath.

The site is maintained by Historic Scotland.[1] According to its excavator, John R.C. Hamilton, there were several periods of occupation of the site: Late Bronze Age farmstead, Early Iron Age farmstead, Iron Age fort, broch period, and wheelhouse settlement.
