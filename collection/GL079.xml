He was the first president born after the independence of the United States from the British Empire. A founder of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the ninth governor of New York, the tenth United States secretary of state, and the eighth vice president of the United States. He won the 1836 presidential election with the endorsement of popular outgoing President <link wikipedia="Andrew_Jackson" osm="2511267" type="relation">Andrew Jackson</link> and the organizational strength of the Democratic Party.

Burg Kreuzenstein is 265 metres (869 ft) above sea level.[1] It was constructed on the remains of an early medieval castle that had fallen into disrepair and was then demolished during the Thirty Years' War. Intended to be a family vault for the Wilczek family, it was rebuilt in the 19th century by Count Nepomuk Wilczek with money from the family's large Silesian coal mines. Kreuzenstein is interesting in that it was constructed out of sections of medieval structures purchased by the family from all over Europe to form an authentic-looking castle. Thus, the castle can be considered both a 'neo-' and 'original' medieval structure.
The castle is sometimes used as a location for films.

After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties in 1954, its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton and James McLamore purchased the company and renamed it "Burger King". Over the next half-century, the company would change hands four times, with its third set of owners, a partnership of TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, taking it public in 2002. In late 2010, 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company, in a deal valued at US$3.26 billion. The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G, along with partner Berkshire Hathaway, eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons, under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International.

</p>
      <p id="GL079_150_002" num_links="4">The village was first mentioned in "letter of protection" by the archbishop Siegfried II. von Eppstein as "castra Holzhusin" back in 1222. In 1537 the "Eppsteiner Weistum" (a list of properties owned by the Lords of Eppstein) lists "Holtzhusen" as a village with 51 farmsteads and a fortification consisting of a double trench and two gates.
From the Middle Ages to the German Mediatisation Holzhausen - as it was called then - was a "Reichsdorf" (village of the empire) with a 2/3 status of imperial immediacy, but apart from that was subordinated to a multitude of lords. After the introduction of the rule "Cuius regio, eius religio" by the "Peace of Augsburg" treaty this led to a convoluted separation of religious affiliations. Starting with the 16th century flax weaving mills became the main economic base for Burgholzhausen. Alongside the village's population lived on the processing of loam from their own quarries to produce pavers, oven- and wall-tiles. Later on in the 17th century fruit growing was introduced. In 1716 a catholic church of baroque style was erected.
In the 17th century the Earls of Ingelheim owned the village. In 1741 the village became part of the Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel. Because of this a legal case was heard at the Imperial Chamber Court. The Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel - William VIII - based his title and the alleged purchase of the village in 1595 by the Earl of Stolberg-Königstein. With the extinction of the family line of the Earl of Hanau-Münzenberg due to the death of Johann Reinhard III. of Hanau in 1736, who was the last heir of the Stolberg family line, William VIII argued to be the rightful inheritor of the village. The Imperial Chamber Court awarded a compensation payment to Baron Franz Adolph Dietrich von Ingelheim and confirmed the reign over the village to William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. As a result, Holzhausen became part of the Office of Rodheim
At the time of the German Mediatisation in 1803 Burgholzhausen was one of the few last free villages of Holy Roman Empire. Between 1806 and 1810 Burgholzhausen was occupied by French troops and then became part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. In 1832 Burgholzhausen became part of the district <link wikipedia="Wetteraukreis" osm="62519" type="relation">Friedberg</link>.
On 19 July 1939 Holzhausen was officially renamed to Burgholzhausen. After the <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>, the township grew considerably due to the influx of refugees. As part of the local government reform in 1972 Burgholzhausen became a suburb of <link wikipedia="Friedrichsdorf" osm="240044477 417339" type="node relation">Friedrichsdorf</link> and now belongs to the district <link wikipedia="Hochtaunuskreis" osm="62566" type="relation">Hochtaunuskreis</link>.
