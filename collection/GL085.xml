Calico received California Historical Landmark #782,[3] and in 2005 was proclaimed by then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to be California's Silver Rush Ghost Town.[4]

Describing the peak as "calico-colored", the peak, the mountain range to which it belonged, and the town that followed were all called Calico.[5] The four prospectors discovered silver in the mountain and opened the Silver King Mine, which was California's largest silver producer in the mid-1880s.[5] A <link wikipedia="Post_office" osm="363499122 4979832588 495969245" type="node node way">post office</link> was established in early 1882, and the Calico Print, a weekly newspaper, started publishing. The town soon supported three hotels, five general stores, a meat market, bars, brothels, and three restaurants and boarding houses. The county established a school district and a voting precinct.[6] The town also had a deputy sheriff and two constables, two lawyers and a justice of the peace, five commissioners, and two doctors. There was also a Wells Fargo office and a telephone and telegraph service.[5] At its height of silver production during 1883 and 1885,[6] Calico had over 500 mines and a population of 1,200 people.[5] Local badmen were buried in the Boot Hill cemetery.[7][8]

The Antico Borgo is in the oldest section of the town, the centro storico, at the top of which are the remains of a castle which predates the 12th century. The Borgo itself is a labyrinth of historic houses which have, over the centuries, been built into the hillside. Stone and marble stairs,frequently under old stone arches, connect the streets. Calitri suffered a devastating earthquake in 1980 and has only been partially rebuilt. The Castello at the top of its distinctive cone shaped hilltop is very impressive for its strong architectural forms. In recent reconstructions they are remerging as an important and physically attractive feature of the town.

The castle continued in use for many years, surviving the English Civil War intact and being extensively modernised in the 1770s. During the 19th century, Calshot Castle was used by the coastguard as a base for combating smuggling. In 1894, however, fresh fears of a French invasion led to it being brought back into use as an artillery fort: a large coastal battery was constructed alongside the older castle and a boom built across Southampton Water, controlled from the castle.

It was known as the Calumet Center. Most of its courses were taught in borrowed classrooms provided by Bishop Noll Institute in Hammond and St. John the Baptist Church in Whiting.[3]  In 1960, the Board of Control authorized the expansion of this two-year extension into a full four-year, degree-granting college.[3]  In doing so, the institution became the first college in the Calumet Region to offer baccalaureate degrees.[4] At that time, St. Joseph's College Calumet Campus moved into a new home, a former furniture store in East Chicago. Classes and administrative work were conducted in this building, which served the college well for 15 years and later became the Administration Building. The East Chicago Campus continued to grow throughout the 1960s.[5] Buildings were donated or acquired on Indianapolis Boulevard and Olcott Avenue to provide classroom and office space, a Library, laboratories, a theater, a communications center, and student recreational facilities.[5] In the Summer of 1971, the College was renamed St. Joseph Calumet College. It officially separated from St. Joseph's College on November 15, 1973, when articles of incorporation were filed with the state of Indiana.[citation needed] On December 31, 1973, the American Oil Company deeded its research and development facilities and 256 acres (103.6 ha) of land to Calumet College.[4] The college moved into its new facilities in January 1976 and is now using the largest of the 23 buildings on the site.[4]

      <p id="GL085_290_001" num_links="2">Guéhenno originally had the archetypal "enclos paroissial" with the parish church, an ossuary, calvary and cemetery. In 1794 however, troops of the Republican Army, pausing on their journey to <link wikipedia="Josselin" osm="145045" type="relation">Josselin</link>, pillaged the village, burnt down the 16th-Century church and severely damaged the calvary which dated back to 1550 and was attributed to the sculptor F. Guillonic. In 1853 the new rector, Abbé Jacquot, set about rebuilding the calvary assisted by his rector Laumaillė and two masons; fortunately the villagers had managed to hide away the fragments left after the soldiers' attack, secreting them in the ossuary, granary and other places and having mastered the rudiments of sculpture, Jacquot even added some extra pieces. Two inscriptions tell the story. "J.GUILLOUIC A FACIT CESTE CROUA DE P[AR] LES P[A]RROISSIE[N]S 1550" and "REFAIT EN 1853 JACQUOT R[ECTEUR] DREAN M[AIRE]. LAUMAILLÉ VICAIRE." Jacquot also added several sculptures to a new ossuary built in 1863. The church was also rebuilt. The calvary has three crosses emerging from a large granite pedestal, the central cross being occupied by Jesus Christ whilst the two robbers executed alongside Jesus hang from the two smaller crosses. At the front of this pedestal, a smaller granite slab forms an altar table and facing the calvary Jacquot placed a column on which the instruments of the passion were carved, a rooster sitting at the top of the column representing <link wikipedia="Saint_Peter" osm="6450566915 6670542940" type="node node">Saint Peter</link>'s denial of Christ. Jacquot also added to the sides of the altar table the images of the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and Ezekiel. Jacquot died in 1866, aged 66 years. The calvary was designated a "monument historique" in 1927. Apart from the rooster topped column and the four prophets which are attributable to Jacquot alone, Jacquot also made some other alterations to pieces originally sculpted by Guillonic. As a result, the attributions are not always crystal clear.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

In 1539, increasing tensions with France encouraged Henry to rethink his coastal defence plans, and Camber Castle was rebuilt and extended over the next year under the direction of the Moravian engineer, Stefan von Haschenperg. The results were considered unsatisfactory and further work was carried out from 1542 to 1543, at great expense, to rectify the problems. The result was a large, concentric artillery fort, with a central keep, surrounded by four circular bastions and a circular entrance bastion, built from stone and brick.

Reverend Pillsbury deeded a large portion of his land to the town council and they immediately agreed it was a good place to lay out a town.  Lots were sold to incoming migrants and on June 9 of 1843 (after some quarreling among the town founders about how to finance it) construction began on the town.  Roads were laid out, post routes established, public buildings erected and people were invited to move there.  The original settlers were entirely of <link wikipedia="New_England" osm="9660059" type="relation">New England</link> origins or were Yankees from upstate New York whose families had moved to that place from <link wikipedia="New_England" osm="9660059" type="relation">New England</link> only one generation earlier, in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War.
