De Champlain named the mountain "Le Lion Couchant", a heraldic image which roughly translates as "The Resting Lion". Ira Allen later referred to the mountain as "Camel's Rump" on a map from 1798. It was not until 1830 that the name "Camel's Hump" came into usage.[4]
The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) lists twelve variant names including Tah-wak-be-dee-ee-so wadso and Catamountain.[5] While place names are determined by local usage the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) serves as a central authority in the United States concerning place names. Since its inception in 1890 the BGN has discouraged the use of the genitive apostrophe.[6] Local usage is often at odds with this policy and so the name of this mountain is alternatively spelled with and without an apostrophe.

During the colonial era, German and French rulers exported West African Dwarf sheep (Djallonké) to France and Germany. These usually ended up in private collections and zoos. The animals selected for export to Europe were almost all of the black belly color type. The chestnut-colored drawing is not prevalent in the Djallonké, but only one of many.  Today these sheeps are called Cameroon sheep or Cameroon Dwarf sheep in Europe. And incorrectly regarded as a separate breed. The International West African Dwarf Specialist Group of the African Ornamental Breeders Association (AOBA) considers what Europeans call the Cameroon sheep just a color type and not a separate breed.

He was the brother of Ernest Flammarion (1846–1936), founder of the Groupe Flammarion publishing house. He was a founder and the first president of the Société astronomique de France, which originally had its own independent journal, BSAF (Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France), first published in 1887. In January 1895, after 13 volumes of L'Astronomie and 8 of BSAF, the two merged, making L’Astronomie the Bulletin of the Societé. The 1895 volume of the combined journal was numbered 9, to preserve the BSAF volume numbering, but this had the consequence that volumes 9 to 13 of L'Astronomie can each refer to two different publications, five years apart from each other.[2]

The mountain is named for its similarity in shape to a belltower (It.: campanile) and it being low (It.: basso) compared to the neighboring Campanile Alto and Brenta Alta. The German alpinist Karl Schulz introduced in 1884 the name Guglia di Brenta ("Guglia = "spire"),[2] a name widely used until World War I and especially enduring in German literature, but considered inappropriate by locals and Italian climbers.[3] Geologically, Campanile Basso is entirely formed of Triassic sedimentary rock, dense and compact dolomite.[4] Due to its inaccessible appearance it was long left untouched during the alpine exploration of the Eastern Alps. Around the turn of the century a competitive race for the first ascent started, which took inspiration from the emerging nationalistic feelings in the region, as much as from the ascent of rock climbing as a sport. Most of the illustrious forebears of modern rock climbing climbed this mountain during the first half of the Twentieth century.

      <p id="GL086_337_002" num_links="2">The history of modern settlement of Campbell dates back to 1805 when a group of Griqua, including Captain Andries Waterboer, travelled with missionary Jan Matthys Kok from Klaarwater (now <link wikipedia="Griekwastad" osm="262720452" type="node">Griquatown</link>) to the territory of the Tswana near the modern town of <link wikipedia="Kuruman" osm="33364952" type="node">Kuruman</link>. Encountering strong springs in a valley at the edge of the Ghaap Plateau, they gave the place the name of Knovel Valley, noting its potential for future crop cultivation. It was only in 1811 that the Reverend Lambert Jansz, accompanying the traveller William Burchell, revisited the place, taking possession of the springs, by now known as Groote Fontein (Great Fountain), in the name of the London Missionary Society.  Before long the name of the place would be changed again: when the Reverend John Campbell, on a tour of inspection in 1813, reached the nascent village and asked its name, he was told it was Campbell.[3]

The formation of the state began with the city, which was founded in 1540 as the Spanish began the conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula. During the colonial period, the city was a rich and important port, but declined after Mexico's independence. Campeche was part of the province of Yucatán but split off in the mid-19th century, mostly due to political friction with the city of Mérida. Much of the state's recent economic revival is due to the finding of petroleum offshore in the 1970s, which has made the coastal cities of Campeche and <link wikipedia="Ciudad_del_Carmen" osm="3402675838" type="node">Ciudad del Carmen</link> important economic centers. The state has important Mayan and colonial sites; however, these are not as well-known or visited as others in the Yucatán.

Located almost entirely within the bounds of Campgaw Mountain Reservation, the mountain offers numerous outdoor recreational opportunities, including the only ski slope in the Watchungs.[3]  Campgaw Mountain is commonly considered to be part of the greater <link wikipedia="Ramapo_Mountains" osm="357581582" type="node">Ramapo Mountains</link> region,[4] but the flora and geology of the mountain is quite different from the surrounding area and more closely resembles the nearby Preakness Range to the south.[5]

The peak of the mountain rises to 752 feet (229 meters)[1] in Mahwah, becoming the fourth highest peak of Watchungs, though the height of the mountain as measured from its base is generally less than 400 feet (122 meters).  A shallow gap exists between Campgaw Mountain and the Preakness and Goffle Hill ranges of the Watchungs to the south, somewhat isolating the ridge from the rest of the Watchung Mountains despite contiguous geology below the surface.  In the north, the mountain terminates at the Ramapo Fault, the western border of the Newark Basin.  Campgaw Mountain also marks the eastern edge of the Ramapo River Valley, forming a sizable basin between itself and the Ramapo Mountains.[6]
