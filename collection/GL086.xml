Burnfoot was built as a council estate between the 1950s and 1970s and is now mostly owned by the Scottish Borders Housing Association and Waverley Housing, two social landlords in the Borders. It is the poorest part of Hawick, with relatively high rates of social deprivation in several areas, especially around Ruberslaw Road and the Meadows, according to the 2001 census. Like many such areas in Scotland, it also has more than its fair share of antisocial behaviour, with many incidents around the Kenilworth Avenue shops.[2] However, its primary school has won praise for its teaching and attitude to various issues in the past.[3]

The tower, originally a three storeyed single square bay, was probably built about 1553 by Bertram Anderson,[2] a nephew of Orde.

Business Bay is part of the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashed Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Ruler of Dubai. Business Bay will be a new 'city' within the city of Dubai and is being built as a commercial, residential and business cluster along a new extension of Dubai Creek extending from Ras Al Khor to Sheikh Zayed Road. Covering an area of 64,000,000 square feet (5,900,000 m2), once completed it will be composed of office and residential towers set in landscaped gardens with a network of roads, pathways and canals. It will become the region's business capital as well as a freehold city.[2]
