Today, Canute businesses include a bank and auto repair shop on Route 66, a strip bar,[3] along with a gas station/convenience store and a motel at the I-40 interchange. Former Oklahoma governor David Walters was born in Canute.

It was once the seat of a bishopric. During the following centuries, Caorle became one of the nine important cities of the Republic of Venice; evidence to that effect are the many <link wikipedia="Istria" osm="8063578" type="relation">Istrian</link> flagstones which compose some monuments in the city, and also the ancient structure of the city with bridge and canals, like a little <link wikipedia="Venice" osm="64778090 44741" type="node relation">Venice</link>.

The amount of shipping at the time warranted the building of a light at the location, and in 1864, funds were given to build the harbor's light. In 1866, the first light was illuminated. This first tower, which housed a fourth-order Fresnel lens, was nothing more than a 25-foot (7.6 m) octagonal tower with a skeleton base. This tower, located on the west end of an island, was connected to the keeper's residence via a 1,300-foot (400 m) wooden walkway. However, because of its location on the island, the light was greatly exposed to the elements along the Pacific and soon was in need of repairs. Over the next 35 years, much of the station's infrastructure had to be repaired or replaced. Several improvements were also made during this time, including the installation of a fog signal and a new boathouse.[1]

The original lighthouse at this site was first lit on 1 August 1870. However, this lighthouse was constructed of timber, and in 1898 these timbers were found to be decaying. This led to the construction of the current cast iron tower, which began operating in October 1905.

It is the tallest lighthouse in Virginia and the second tallest in the United States.[3] This particular tower is the third lighthouse at this location. The first lighthouse at Cape Charles was a 55-foot (17 m) masonry tower completed in 1828. It was quickly deemed inadequate for its important seacoast location due to its low height and poor visibility at sea. It was soon threatened by erosion so in 1864 it was replaced by a 150-foot (46 m) masonry tower built further inland. Located a little more than a mile southwest of the old tower and 600 feet from the shoreline, the impressive 150-foot-tall conical brick tower was similar in appearance to the 1857 <link wikipedia="Cape_May_Lighthouse" osm="261320234" type="way">Cape May Lighthouse</link>, painted white and topped with a dark brown lantern room. In 1892, a twenty-five-foot red band was painted around the white tower's midsection, about sixty feet up from the base, to make it more visible during the day. By the 1890s, it too was threatened by beach erosion which jetties built to protect it failed to halt, and with the lighthouse now only 300 feet from the ocean and the shoreline eroding at a rate of 37 feet per year it was decided that a third lighthouse needed to be built three quarters of a mile inland.

      <p id="GL091_157_002" num_links="2">The first proposal for Cape Charles’ third lighthouse called for a conical structure of iron plates, similar in design to the new <link wikipedia="Cape_Henry_Lighthouse" osm="402305487 402305719" type="way way">Cape Henry Lighthouse</link>, but in the end, a bid of $78,200 was accepted to construct 191-foot (58 m) octagonal steel skeletal towers at both Cape Charles and <link wikipedia="Hog_Island_(Virginia)" osm="356562367" type="node">Hog Island</link>, a barrier island twenty miles to the north where another lighthouse was being threatened by shoreline erosion. This design had several advantages: it was much cheaper than the Cape Henry model, and distinct enough from the Cape Henry tower that the two would not be mistaken for each other.

The large number of ships that ran aground because of these shifting sandbars gave this area the nickname "Graveyard of the Atlantic."  It also led Congress to authorize the construction of the Cape Hatteras Light. Its 210-foot height makes it the tallest brick lighthouse structure in the United States and 2nd in the world.[5][6] Since its base is almost at sea level, it is only the 15th highest light in the United States, the first 14 being built on higher ground.

The original lighthouse was the first authorized by the U.S. government, dating from 1792.  It was also the first federal construction project under the Constitution, for an original contract amount of $15,200 (an additional $2,500 was required to finish the lighthouse). A second lighthouse was built and completed in 1881 a short distance away after concern arose about the stability of the first.  Both towers of the light station were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

      <p id="GL091_228_002" num_links="2">The Cape Hinchinbrook Lighthouse was first established in 1910 to mark the entrance to Prince William Sound. Congress authorized the construction of a lighthouse at this point in 1906 appropriating $125,000 for its construction. However, the full amount was not authorized in one lump sum. The money was appropriated over a number of years with $25,000 in 1906, $50,000 in 1907 and the rest in 1908. As a result, construction did not begin until 1909. In the winter of 1909 a temporary fixed white light was established on the second story of the building under construction. Due to the earthquakes in 1927 and 1928, which caused instability in the cliff around the lighthouse, it was felt a new light should be built on solid rock. The new 67-foot (20 m) octagonal tower was completed in 1934. The lighthouse was automated in 1974 and a solar-powered Vega lens was installed.
