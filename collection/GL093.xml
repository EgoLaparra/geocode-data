In 1539, increasing tensions with France encouraged Henry to rethink his coastal defence plans, and Camber Castle was rebuilt and extended over the next year under the direction of the Moravian engineer, Stefan von Haschenperg. The results were considered unsatisfactory and further work was carried out from 1542 to 1543, at great expense, to rectify the problems. The result was a large, concentric artillery fort, with a central keep, surrounded by four circular bastions and a circular entrance bastion, built from stone and brick.

Roads were laid out, post routes established, public buildings erected and people were invited to move there.  The original settlers were entirely of <link wikipedia="New_England" osm="9660059" type="relation">New England</link> origins or were Yankees from upstate New York whose families had moved to that place from <link wikipedia="New_England" osm="9660059" type="relation">New England</link> only one generation earlier, in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War.

De Champlain named the mountain "Le Lion Couchant", a heraldic image which roughly translates as "The Resting Lion". Ira Allen later referred to the mountain as "Camel's Rump" on a map from 1798. It was not until 1830 that the name "Camel's Hump" came into usage.[4]
The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) lists twelve variant names including Tah-wak-be-dee-ee-so wadso and Catamountain.[5] While place names are determined by local usage the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) serves as a central authority in the United States concerning place names. Since its inception in 1890 the BGN has discouraged the use of the genitive apostrophe.[6] Local usage is often at odds with this policy and so the name of this mountain is alternatively spelled with and without an apostrophe.

During the colonial era, German and French rulers exported West African Dwarf sheep (Djallonké) to France and Germany. These usually ended up in private collections and zoos. The animals selected for export to Europe were almost all of the black belly color type. The chestnut-colored drawing is not prevalent in the Djallonké, but only one of many.  Today these sheeps are called Cameroon sheep or Cameroon Dwarf sheep in Europe. And incorrectly regarded as a separate breed. The International West African Dwarf Specialist Group of the African Ornamental Breeders Association (AOBA) considers what Europeans call the Cameroon sheep just a color type and not a separate breed.

The mountain is named for its similarity in shape to a belltower (It.: campanile) and it being low (It.: basso) compared to the neighboring Campanile Alto and Brenta Alta. The German alpinist Karl Schulz introduced in 1884 the name Guglia di Brenta ("Guglia = "spire"),[2] a name widely used until World War I and especially enduring in German literature, but considered inappropriate by locals and Italian climbers.[3] Geologically, Campanile Basso is entirely formed of Triassic sedimentary rock, dense and compact dolomite.[4] Due to its inaccessible appearance it was long left untouched during the alpine exploration of the Eastern Alps. Around the turn of the century a competitive race for the first ascent started, which took inspiration from the emerging nationalistic feelings in the region, as much as from the ascent of rock climbing as a sport. Most of the illustrious forebears of modern rock climbing climbed this mountain during the first half of the Twentieth century.

      <p id="GL093_449_002" num_links="2">The history of modern settlement of Campbell dates back to 1805 when a group of Griqua, including Captain Andries Waterboer, travelled with missionary Jan Matthys Kok from Klaarwater (now <link wikipedia="Griekwastad" osm="262720452" type="node">Griquatown</link>) to the territory of the Tswana near the modern town of <link wikipedia="Kuruman" osm="33364952" type="node">Kuruman</link>. Encountering strong springs in a valley at the edge of the Ghaap Plateau, they gave the place the name of Knovel Valley, noting its potential for future crop cultivation. It was only in 1811 that the Reverend Lambert Jansz, accompanying the traveller William Burchell, revisited the place, taking possession of the springs, by now known as Groote Fontein (Great Fountain), in the name of the London Missionary Society.  Before long the name of the place would be changed again: when the Reverend John Campbell, on a tour of inspection in 1813, reached the nascent village and asked its name, he was told it was Campbell.[3]
