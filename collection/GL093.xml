He wanted to impress outsiders and set about purposefully to develop Helsingør as a gateway city. One of the things he did was to establish in the town not only the priory for the Carmelites but also a Franciscan friary and a Dominican priory.

The destruction in 1862 prompted the construction of the Main Building (literally the main building of Rensselaer at the time).  The destruction of the Main Building in 1904 prompted the Institute to consider expanding the campus.  Being built around a hill, the Institute considered extending the campus downhill within the downtown Troy area and even considered leaving Troy altogether by accepting <link wikipedia="Columbia_University" osm="169626373 8391533" type="way relation">Columbia University</link>'s proposed merger with its <link wikipedia="New_York_City" osm="61785451 575213527 175905" type="node way relation">New York City</link> campus. Ultimately, the decision was made to remain in Troy but move uphill, away from the downtown area.[1]
In 1905 Andrew Carnegie donated $125,000 to replace the Main Building.  As part of the Institute's plan to move uphill, the 10-acre (40,000 m2) Walter Phelps Warren estate was acquired.  There the Carnegie Building was erected, made of Harvard brick and Indiana limestone.  It was completed in September 1906 at a cost of $133,000. The Carnegie Building was dedicated along with the Walker Laboratory on June 12, 1907.[2]

Its beauty and fertility had attracted the particular attention of the <link wikipedia="Messina" osm="39514" type="relation">Zanclaeans</link>, who in consequence invited the <link wikipedia="Samos" osm="452381 5305923" type="relation relation">Samians</link> and <link wikipedia="Miletus" osm="32255827" type="way">Milesians</link> (after the capture of Miletus by the <link wikipedia="Iran" osm="424298311 304938" type="node relation">Persians</link>, 494 BC) to establish themselves on this part of the Sicilian coast. Events, however, turned their attention elsewhere, and they ended with occupying Zancle itself.[3] At a later period the project was resumed by the Sikel leader Ducetius, who, after his expulsion from Sicily by <link wikipedia="Syracuse,_Sicily" osm="1932675079 39169" type="node relation">Syracuse</link> and his exile at <link wikipedia="Corinth" osm="161650096" type="node">Corinth</link>, returned at the head of a body of colonists from the <link wikipedia="Peloponnese" osm="5913779" type="relation">Peloponnese</link>; and having obtained much support from the neighbouring Siculi, especially from Archonides, dynast of Herbita, according to Diodorus Siculus founded a city on the coast, which was called Kalè Akté (The Fair Shore or Beautiful Coast).[4]  The date given by Diodorus is 446 BC, but in another passus the same author says that Ducetius colonised Kale Akte in 440 BC, the same year he died. In addition, recent excavations at Caronia, which is clearly the site of the Hellenistic and Roman town  Kale Akte, have revealed only very sparse remains from the 5th century BC, and show that a Sikel settlement already existed here in the early 5th century BC.[5] It is possible that Ducetius founded the colony on the site of this already existing Sikel settlement, just as he had done at Menai and Paliké.
