A second parallel cantilever bridge was completed in 1958 to deal with the increased traffic. Later, seismic problems made the 1927 span unsafe in case of an earthquake, and led to the construction, and 2003 opening, of a replacement: a suspension bridge officially named the Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge, in memory of iron worker Al Zampa, who played an integral role in the construction of numerous <link wikipedia="San_Francisco_Bay_Area" osm="2157162589" type="node">San Francisco Bay Area</link> bridges. The Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge carries westbound traffic from Vallejo to Crockett, and the 1958 cantilever span carries eastbound traffic.

The first courthouse was designed by Peter Herold and James McMullin was contracted as the builder. When McMullin failed to meet expectations and the contract was awarded to John Lacey who also failed to honor his contract. The county wished to finish the construction and in desperation placed the contract with John Rankin. Unfortunately for the county, Rankin too failed to meet the obligations of the contract and George Hampson was selected instead. Hampson remained at this post and saw the courthouse into completion in 1837.

The national district consists of 134 contributing residential rowhouses built between the 1860s and 1880s. They are two- and three-story brownstone buildings in the neo-Grec and late Italianate styles located in a rectangle bounded by Carroll, President, Smith, and Hoyt Streets.[3]  They feature uniform setbacks, even cornice lines and stoop levels, and fenced front yards and landscaped gardens.[4]  These were the result of surveyor Richard Butt, who in 1846 planned gardens in front of the brownstone houses in the oldest section of the neighborhood. The homes are set farther back from the street than is common in Brooklyn, and the large gardens became an iconic depiction of the neighborhood.[5] All the houses in the district, which is afforded a degree of privacy by the street pattern that discourages through traffic on Carroll and President Streets, were built between 1869 and 1884.[2]

Further changes were made in 1918 and before the second world war an air raid shelters was added.  The Casa Rocca Piccola Family Shelter is the second air-raid shelter to be dug in Malta.[10]

It owes its name to the eight atlantes decorating its facade, termed "omenoni" ("big men" in Milanese), which were sculpted by Antonio Abondio,[1] most probably on a design by Leoni.[2] Lions (a reference to the "Leoni" family)[3]  are a recurring theme of its decorations; in particular, a large relief placed under the cornice depicts two lions tearing a satyr into pieces. The overall style of the palace and the decorations have been noted to include several references to the art of Michelangelo.[4] The internal courtyard, modified in 1929 by Piero Portaluppi, has a colonnade with metopes and triglyphs.

      <p id="GL094_482_002" num_links="3">Since it became a Roman municipium the town has been the most important center of the zone. After a spell of decline, due to the fall of the Roman Empire and the barbaric invasion, Casale became a free municipality and from the 15th century to the 16th century was the capital of the Palaiologos. Then the Gonzaga got hold of the town and built one of the biggest and most important citadel of Europe. In the 17th century and the 18th century was besieged by both the Spanish and French armies, interested in its strategical position; during Italian unification Casale has been one of the defensive bulwarks against the Austrian Empire. Today Casale, in the middle of the industrial triangle <link wikipedia="Turin" osm="63621589 43992" type="node relation">Turin</link>-<link wikipedia="Milan" osm="62505581 44915" type="node relation">Milan</link>-<link wikipedia="Genoa" osm="66586322 44875" type="node relation">Genoa</link>, is an important industrial center, known for the production of cement and the closed factory Eternit, that produced the homonymous material, very dangerous due to the presence of asbestos. Thousands of inhabitants[citation needed] of Casale have died from mesothelioma,[5] a fatal disease caused by the breathing of asbestos. In 2012, former executives and Eternit shareholders Stephan Schmidheiny and Louis de Cartier were ordered to pay $32.5 million to the town of Casale Monferrato after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter for exposing workers and townspeople to asbestos.[6]
