The Castro, or hill fort, is located at the top of the hill, naturally defended by a scarp to the south. It covers about one hectare and was first occupied in about 2900 BCE, during the Chalcolithic or Copper Age. It is registered as a Zona Especial de Protecção (a Special Protection Area) and also classified as a Sitio de Interesse Público (Site of Public Interest).[1][2][3]

</p>
      <p id="GL097_082_002" num_links="2">The site was identified and first excavated by António Inácio Marques da Costa in 1906. More recently, Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares of the Museu de Arqueologia e Etnografia do Distrito de Setúbal (Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography of Setúbal District--MOADS) have been excavating and studying the site. The geographical location of the Castro is surrounded by good agricultural land and is close to the sea and several rivers, including  the <link wikipedia="Sado_River" osm="4576911" type="relation">River Sado estuary</link>, which was likely an important source of food. The first phase of development took place from the Copper Age until the early Bronze Age (about 2000 BCE). The occupants practised agriculture and livestock rearing, although hunting and gathering of molluscs from the nearby sea were also carried out. It is thought that the Castro’s dead were buried in the nearby necropolis known as the <link wikipedia="Artificial_caves_of_Casal_do_Pardo" osm="1191138578" type="node">Artificial caves of Casal do Pardo</link>. After a period of abandonment of around 1700 years the Chibanes site was again used as a place of residence during the Iron Age (3rd-2nd century BCE) and during the Roman occupation of Portugal, when the province of Lusitania formed part of the Roman Empire. It was subsequently the site of an Islamic castle during the 12th century AD during the Almohad period of the Muslim occupation of Portugal, when it was known as Alcaria.[2][3][4]

In 1534, during the reign of Henry VIII, the Church of England split from Rome, and Catholic worship was outlawed. Until the 18th century, Catholics faced fines, loss of property and social exclusion, and Catholic priests were hunted down, imprisoned and martyred. The main landowners in Sheffield were the Dukes of Norfolk, and the Shrewsbury Chapel in the now Anglican parish church remained Catholic until 1933. During the reordering of St Mary's in 1970, at the invitation of the Anglican Cathedral, Mass was celebrated on the altar of the Shrewsbury Chapel once again. The Altar still retains its Catholic consecration crosses, and relics, making this possible.[1] Mass was celebrated in a few houses of gentry in Sheffield, including in a house on Fargate that belonged to the Duke of Norfolk, which had a hidden chapel in its roof.[2]

      <p id="GL097_351_001" num_links="2">The church of St. Bartholomew was established probably simultaneously with the city of Plzen around the year 1295. Originally, it was only an affiliated branch of the Church of All Saints in Malice, which is a part of the Roudná neighbourhood (Roudná is a part of the statutory city of Pilsen and is located in the northern neighborhood in the middle of the city in the urban district Pilsen, Czech Republic). The patron of both churches was the Czech king; in 1310 the king Henry of Bohemia (1265-1335) bestowed the patronal right upon the Teutonic Order. However, the same year, the king was banished from the Czech country and the Order didn’t dare to take hold of their right. The Teutonic Order finally enforced this right from John of Bohemia (1296-1346) in 1322. However, next problem arose with the conflict over a presbytery with the Church of All Saints, resulting in favour of the Teutonic Order in 1342. The takeover of the clergy houses therefore probably became the motive for the initiation of the church construction. The Teutonic Order remained its patron until 1546, when the city of Pilsen got the abovementioned patronal right. The Diecese of Pilsner was established by <link wikipedia="Pope_John_Paul_II" osm="320953156 2021754742 5635848333 6410437520" type="node node node node">John Paul II</link>  on 31 May 1993, and then the parish church became a cathedral, the urban church of the <link wikipedia="Bishop" osm="96907196" type="node">bishop</link>.

      <p id="GL097_367_001" num_links="4">The 38-metre-high, five-domed, stone cathedral was built by Vladimir of Novgorod between 1045 and 1050 to replace an oaken cathedral also built by Bishop Joachim the Korsunian in the late tenth century[1] (making it the oldest church building in <link wikipedia="Russia" osm="424314830 60189" type="node relation">Russia</link> proper and, with the exception of the Arkhyz and Shoana churches, the oldest building of any kind still in use in the country).  It was consecrated by Bishop Luka Zhidiata (1035–1060) on September 14, in 1050 or 1052, the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross. (A fresco just inside the south entrance depicts Sts. Constantine and Helena, who found the true cross in the fourth century; it is one of the oldest works of art in the cathedral and is thought to commemorate its dedication.)[2]  While it is commonly known as St. Sophia's, it is not named for any of the female saints of that name (i.e., Sophia of Rome or Sophia the Martyr); rather, the name comes from the Greek for wisdom (Σoφíα, from whence we get words like philosophia or philosophy—"the love of wisdom"), and thus Novgorod's cathedral is dedicated to the Holy Wisdom of God, in imitation of the <link wikipedia="Hagia_Sophia" osm="109862851 1555271" type="way relation">Hagia Sophia</link> cathedral of Constantinople. It replaced an even older wooden, 13-domed church built in or around 989 by Bishop Ioakim Korsunianin, the first bishop of Novgorod.  The main, golden cupola, was gilded by Archbishop Ioann (1388–1415) in 1408.  The sixth (and the largest) dome crowns a tower which leads to the upper galleries.  In medieval times these were said to hold the Novgorodian treasury and there was a library there, said to have been started by <link wikipedia="Yaroslav_the_Wise" osm="1140971262" type="node">Yaroslav the Wise</link>.

The current Archbishop, Lev (Nikolai L'vovich Tserpitskii),[3] has reestablished a library there, in keeping with the ancient tradition.  As of 2004, it housed some 5,000 volumes.[4]  A Sunday school is also held in the gallery.[5]

Since the Catlin property was too small to support the school, Catlin Gabel purchased the Honey Hollow Farm in 1958, relocating the Upper School there in the fall.  Nine years later, the Middle School relocated there, followed by the Lower School a year later, in 1968.
