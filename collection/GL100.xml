Krishtopenko, who had experience in the <link wikipedia="Crimea" osm="7750160" type="relation">Crimea</link>, planted the first deciduous and coniferous trees in the garden. For his work, Krishtopenko drew lovers of gardening-vernentsev Kutaberdin, Sergeev, Chvanov and others. After studying the climatic conditions and the structure of the soil, Krishtopenko came to the conclusion that not only Central Asian plants, but also species characteristic of Central Russia could grow in the garden, as well as in the entire fortification of the city.

Ericson built the structure in the then-recently popularized bandshell form, which projected sound toward the audience through its rear wall. The bandstand was completed in three weeks; its opening concert hosted the largest crowd that the park had ever held until that time. From its inception until 1925, the bandstand continued to host concerts, usually once per week; movie screenings and church services were also held at the bandstand. Beginning in 1947, the bandstand became an event stage for the Midwest Corn Show, which later became the Orion Fall Festival; the structure is now mainly used during the festival.[2]

However, with the introduction of rail transportation and steamships, increasing quantity of post quickly made the building insufficient.  A new central post building was therefore built at Rödbotorget (near today's Sheraton Hotel) to the design of Albert Törnqvist (1819–1898).  On its inauguration in the mid-1870s, the new building was well-dimensioned for its purpose, but before the end of the century explosive volumes of postcards had made the headquarters outdated again and in 1896 a decision was taken to move into a larger building.[3]

This statistical region in the Sava Hills is the smallest region in the country in terms of both area and population.

The natural and geographic features of this region create conditions for industrial activities and more than a third of gross value added is still generated by manufacturing, mining, and other industry. In 2013, the region once again recorded the highest negative annual population growth rate (−11.9‰), which was mainly a result of migration to other statistical regions. Among all statistical regions in 2013, this region had the highest negative net migration between regions; namely, −9.5. This region also stands out by age of mothers at childbirth.
In 2013 first-time mothers in the region were on average 28.5 years old, whereas first-time mothers in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region were on average 1 year older. In the same year, the number of unemployed persons increased further. The registered unemployment rate was among the highest in the country (16.6%). In comparison with other regions, this is 7 percentage points more than in the region with the lowest registered unemployment rate, <link wikipedia="Upper_Carniola_Statistical_Region" osm="1699230" type="relation">Upper Carniola</link>, and almost 1 percentage point less than in the region with the highest unemployment rate, the <link wikipedia="Mura_Statistical_Region" osm="1703918" type="relation">Mura Statistical Region</link>. According to the labour migration index, this is the most residential statistical region. In 2013, 60% of people in the region worked in their region of residence, and 40% worked in another region.

This was located on the outskirts of what would become <link wikipedia="Anchorage,_Kentucky" osm="153707476 130395" type="node relation">Anchorage, Kentucky</link>. In 1873, due to overcrowding at both of Kentucky's mental hospitals, the House of Reform was converted into the Fourth Kentucky Lunatic Asylum, with Dr. C.C. Forbes as its first Superintendent. The following year an act of the legislature renamed it the Central Kentucky Lunatic Asylum. In late 1887, it received its own post office, called simply "Asylum". The following year its name was changed to "Lakeland", and the institution was commonly referred to as "Lakeland Hospital" or "Lakeland Asylum". By 1900, its official name had been changed to the Central Kentucky Asylum for the Insane.  By 1912 it was known as Central State Hospital. Comparable institutions are Eastern State Hospital at Lexington in Fayette County and Western State Hospital at Hopkinsville, Christian County, Kentucky. All three were administered by the Board of Charitable Organizations.

      <p id="GL100_200_002" num_links="3">The line was opened as the Central London Railway in 1900, crossing central London on an east–west axis, as the third deep-level Tube line to be built after electric trains made them possible. It was later extended to the western suburb of Ealing. After the Second World War, the line was expanded considerably into the recently constructed suburbs, taking over steam-hauled outer-suburban routes to the borders of London and beyond to the east. This realised plans that had been delayed by the war, when construction stopped and the unused tunnels were used as air-raid shelters and factories. However, suburban growth proved to be less than expected, and of the planned expansions one (to Denham, Buckinghamshire) was cut short due to its location in the Metropolitan Green Belt and another (to <link wikipedia="Ongar_railway_station" osm="2376594758" type="node">Ongar</link>) ultimately closed in 1994 due to low patronage; the section between Epping and Ongar later became part of the <link wikipedia="Epping_Ongar_Railway" osm="147290383 165230" type="way relation">Epping Ongar Railway</link>. The Central line has mostly been operated by automatic train operation since a major refurbishment in the 1990s, although all trains still carry drivers. Many of its stations are of historic interest, from turn-of-the-century Central London Railway buildings in west London to post-war modernist designs on the West Ruislip and Hainault branches, as well as Victorian-era Eastern Counties Railway and Great Eastern Railway buildings east of <link wikipedia="Stratford_station" osm="5257403774" type="node">Stratford</link>, from when the line to Epping was a rural branch line.

Two skippers Jens Mohr and Jens í Dali established two maritime schools (skipper schools) in Tórshavn in 1893. In 1896 Dánjal í Ungagarði established a skipper's school in <link wikipedia="Porkeri" osm="29023787 2181486" type="node relation">Porkeri</link> and Hans Djurholm started a skippers school in <link wikipedia="Glyvrar" osm="29023740 2529860" type="node relation">Glyvrar</link> in <link wikipedia="Eysturoy" osm="1423024" type="relation">Eysturoy</link> in 1903. The two brothers Jákup and Jógvan Joensen (they were called "Jákup and Jógvan við Stein") started their skipper's school in Tórshavn in 1904. In 1905 Jens Pauli í Dali took over his father's school in Tórshavn. All these schools were private and only open in winther time from 1 November to late February. The first maritime school which was built for the same purpose opened on 1 November 1905 by the two Danes Viggo Ryving-Jensen and Andrias Nielsen. In 1917 the exams became both oral and in writing. In 1925 Faroese fishermen went to <link wikipedia="Greenland" osm="424312026 2184073" type="node relation">Greenland</link> to fish, but the problem was that the education of the skippers and the first mates on the Faroese fishing boats only permitted them to steer and maneuvre a boat or ship around the Faroe Island and not as far as in the waters near Greenland. Faroese authorities therefore asked Danish authorities for help. In 1927 Danish authorities established a Maritime school in Tórshavn. They restored the school building, Sjómansskúlin, of Ryving-Jensen and Styrmand Nielsen, which at that point had stopped teaching and used it for the new maritime educations. A Dane, H. A. Guldhammer, was the principal for the first two years, after that Jens Pauli í Dali was the principal until 1956. In 1929 the school started an education for motormen.[1]

An electronic bell system given by J.E. Davis and A.D. Davis, two of the Davis Brothers who controlled <link wikipedia="Winn-Dixie" osm="4076704481 262639542" type="node way">Winn-Dixie</link>, was used until it finally broke down in 1975. In 1976, $200,000 from accumulated student fees was used to buy the initial set of 49 bells.[2] A Dutch bellfoundry, Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry[7]  designed, fabricated and installed the full carillon.  In May 1979 the carillon was dedicated in two recitals by Milford Myhre, Carillonneur of the Bok Singing Tower, Lake Wales FL, who had served as consultant for the instrument.[4]

Twenty people died when a United States Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler aircraft, while flying too low, against regulations, in order for the pilots to "have fun" and "take videos of the scenery", cut a cable supporting a gondola of an aerial tramway. Joseph Schweitzer, one of the two American pilots, confessed in 2012 that he had burned the tape containing incriminating evidence upon returning to the American base.[1] The pilot, Captain Richard J.

Later they were found guilty of obstruction of justice and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman for having destroyed a videotape recorded from the plane, and were dismissed from the Marine Corps.[1] The disaster, and the subsequent acquittal of the pilots, strained relations between the U.S. and Italy.[2]

They belong to the end of Neolithic and early Eneolithic, or the period 4500-3500 BC, during the developed and ending phase of the Vinča culture when the first evidence of metallurgy appeared. The culture then disappears as the population presumably migrated. Both settlements were large, spreading on 40 to 60 ha (99 to 148 acres). Findings from the later Hallstatt culture were also discovered. The most important artifacts, kept in the People's Museum in Smederevska Palanka, are the anthropomorphic figurines of high artistic and artisan value. One of the most valuable and considered unique is the one called "Woman in labor", due to its contracted position. In total, there are over 1,000 figurines, some complete, some damaged, but it is estimated that at least 3,000 of them are in personal collections.[4]
