The fortress was built on the orders of King Carl X of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde, 1658 to protect the newly acquired province of Bohuslän from hostile attacks. The site of Marstrand was chosen because of its location and its access to an ice free port. The fortress was decommissioned as a permanent defense installation in 1882, but remained in military use until the early 1990s.[1]

Since the harbor almost never freezes, part of the Swedish Navy was stationed here. To defend Marstrand, Karl X Gustav decided to build a fortress on the island. 
On July 23, 1677, after a  attack on the fortifications in Marstrand Carlsten was conquered by Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve, the <link wikipedia="Denmark" osm="432424968 50046" type="node relation">Danish</link> military commander in <link wikipedia="Norway" osm="424297198 1059668 2978650" type="node relation relation">Norway</link>.

Carlton Hill's population was always poor, though, and by the early 20th century the area was Brighton's worst slum: overcrowding, crime and disease were rife.  Extensive slum clearance in the mid-20th century introduced high-density tower blocks, but some old buildings remain: in 2008, Brighton and Hove City Council designated part of Carlton Hill as the city's 34th conservation area. The area now has housing of various styles and ages, large offices and small-scale industry; there are also churches, a school and some open space.

Carmel High is known for its view of the Santa Lucia Mountains with a peek of Point Lobos and the Pacific Ocean. It is in one of the most affluent school districts in California, due to a state law which allows the school to opt out of ADA (average daily attendance) funding, choosing instead to receive revenue from local property taxes, which in Carmel's case, are quite high. As a result, Carmel High School salary schedules for teachers, counselors, and administrators are amongst some of the highest in the state of California. Carmel Unified Schools District is the second largest geographical district in the state of California enrolling students up to 40 miles (64 km) south of Carmel and 20 miles (32 km) east. Cities represented by Carmel High School students include <link wikipedia="Carmel-by-the-Sea,_California" osm="5163885" type="relation">Carmel</link>, Big Sur, Pebble Beach, and <link wikipedia="Carmel_Valley_Village,_California" osm="9469892" type="relation">Carmel Valley</link>. Built in 1940, the school has recently made significant capital improvements including a new performing arts theater, math wing, science wing, and library with plans to renovate the current administration building. Both the theater and science wing utilized "green" construction practices, such as energy efficient lights and appliances.

The destruction in 1862 prompted the construction of the Main Building (literally the main building of Rensselaer at the time).  The destruction of the Main Building in 1904 prompted the Institute to consider expanding the campus.  Being built around a hill, the Institute considered extending the campus downhill within the downtown Troy area and even considered leaving Troy altogether by accepting <link wikipedia="Columbia_University" osm="169626373 8391533" type="way relation">Columbia University</link>'s proposed merger with its <link wikipedia="New_York_City" osm="61785451 575213527 175905" type="node way relation">New York City</link> campus. Ultimately, the decision was made to remain in Troy but move uphill, away from the downtown area.[1]
In 1905 Andrew Carnegie donated $125,000 to replace the Main Building.  As part of the Institute's plan to move uphill, the 10-acre (40,000 m2) Walter Phelps Warren estate was acquired.  There the Carnegie Building was erected, made of Harvard brick and Indiana limestone.  It was completed in September 1906 at a cost of $133,000. The Carnegie Building was dedicated along with the Walker Laboratory on June 12, 1907.[2]

Its beauty and fertility had attracted the particular attention of the <link wikipedia="Messina" osm="39514" type="relation">Zanclaeans</link>, who in consequence invited the <link wikipedia="Samos" osm="452381 5305923" type="relation relation">Samians</link> and <link wikipedia="Miletus" osm="32255827" type="way">Milesians</link> (after the capture of Miletus by the <link wikipedia="Iran" osm="424298311 304938" type="node relation">Persians</link>, 494 BC) to establish themselves on this part of the Sicilian coast. Events, however, turned their attention elsewhere, and they ended with occupying Zancle itself.[3] At a later period the project was resumed by the Sikel leader Ducetius, who, after his expulsion from Sicily by <link wikipedia="Syracuse,_Sicily" osm="1932675079 39169" type="node relation">Syracuse</link> and his exile at <link wikipedia="Corinth" osm="161650096" type="node">Corinth</link>, returned at the head of a body of colonists from the <link wikipedia="Peloponnese" osm="5913779" type="relation">Peloponnese</link>; and having obtained much support from the neighbouring Siculi, especially from Archonides, dynast of Herbita, according to Diodorus Siculus founded a city on the coast, which was called Kalè Akté (The Fair Shore or Beautiful Coast).[4]  The date given by Diodorus is 446 BC, but in another passus the same author says that Ducetius colonised Kale Akte in 440 BC, the same year he died. In addition, recent excavations at Caronia, which is clearly the site of the Hellenistic and Roman town  Kale Akte, have revealed only very sparse remains from the 5th century BC, and show that a Sikel settlement already existed here in the early 5th century BC.[5] It is possible that Ducetius founded the colony on the site of this already existing Sikel settlement, just as he had done at Menai and Paliké.

Carora flourished in colonial times having a population of nearly 10,000. As of 1911, the neighboring country was devoted principally to raising horses, mules and cattle; in addition to hides and leather, it exported rubber and other forest products.  As of 2005 the main economic activity of the area is still cattle ranching, but on milk production and milk products. In the 1990s grapes and wine making became important.

British Waterways were hoping to restore it as part of the upgrade to Bow Back Rivers which took place for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but the gantries which enabled the gates to be raised were demolished to accommodate a wide bridge giving access to the main stadium. After the Games, most of the overbridge was removed. Funding for the restoration of the lock was in place by early 2016, and it is expected to be brought back into use in 2017.
