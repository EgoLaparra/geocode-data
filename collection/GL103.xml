During the long recovery he was particularly helped by a young part-time nurse, Monique Bourgeois, who had answered his advertisement seeking "a young and pretty nurse".[3] Matisse asked her to pose for him, which she did for several drawings and paintings.  In 1943 Bourgeois entered the Dominican convent in Vence, a nearby town, and became Sister Jacques-Marie. Matisse eventually bought a home at Vence, not far from the convent where the young nun was stationed.  She visited him and told him of the plans the Dominicans had to build a chapel beside the girls' high school which they operated in Vence.  She asked Matisse if he would help with the design of the chapel.  He had never done anything like it, but Matisse agreed to help, beginning in 1947. Father Marie-Alain Couturier, who collaborated on several artistic Catholic churches after World War II, was also involved in the project.

According to family relatives, his great-grandfather James Jackson immigrated to France from England in 1812, one of many who came to France in the 19th Century to teach steel production methods.[4] He achieved a distinction in Mathematics and Science and served as an Artillery Officer during World War I before returning to the École centrale Paris in 1919 from which he graduated as Ingenieur des Arts et Manufactures in 1921. He joined the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) as a probationer in the Rolling Stock and Motive Power section at Lyon-Mouche depot, but foreseeing poor prospects he left in 1924 and joined the Société Industrielle des Telephones, soon becoming as assistant manager. In 1925 he joined the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans (PO) and, along with Finnish Engineer Kyösti Kylälä jointly designed the Kylchap exhaust system. While his principles met with scepticism No. 3566, the first locomotive rebuilt to Chapelon's design was an outstanding success and from 1929 to 1936 several other locomotives were rebuilt to Chapelon's designs.[5]

      <p id="GL103_396_002" num_links="2">The area that is now the town of Charlemont was surveyed by colonists in 1736, with settlement following in the early 1740s.  It was abandoned during King George's War in the late 1740s, and resettled soon after that war ended.  The village center was the principal nexus of this early settlement, even including a grist mill on Mill Brook.  Significant population growth did not take place until the 1760s, and the town incorporated in 1765.  The village was the site of an early tavern, where the 1787 Charlemont Inn now stands; it is said that Benedict Arnold stayed there in the early days of the American Revolutionary War.  The town's economy was based on agriculture, taking advantage of the fertile floodplain of the <link wikipedia="Deerfield_River" osm="5454709" type="relation">Deerfield River</link>.  The village experienced a growth spurt in the third quarter of the 19th century, when the <link wikipedia="Hoosac_Tunnel" osm="8028438" type="way">Hoosac Tunnel</link> construction brought workers to the town, and continued through the end of the 19th century.

It is a middle-class area with many single-family homes that is in proximity to many of Baltimore's urban amenities. The neighborhood began in 1869 when 50 acres (200,000 m2) of land were purchased for development. The land was divided and turned over to various builders who constructed home exteriors, leaving the interiors to be custom built according to buyer specifications. The area was first developed as a streetcar suburb in the early 20th century, and is thought to be the first community to employ tract housing tactics.[5] At the time, the area was known as Peabody Heights; the moniker Charles Village, derived from Charles Street, the area's major north-south corridor, was coined in the 1970s as the beginning of a process of conceptually grouping a large and somewhat heterogeneous area. The neighborhood history has been researched and published by Gregory J. Alexander and Paul K. Williams in their book Charles Village: A Brief History (The History Press, 2009).[6]
