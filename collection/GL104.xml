A mix of yuppie and upper-middle-class gentrification has influenced much of the area, as it has in many of Boston's neighborhoods, but Charlestown still maintains a strong Irish-American population and "Townie" identity.

The county residents later became staunch supporters of independence and the American Revolution, and Founding Father Patrick Henry was one of its most famous residents.  His grave and the national memorial dedicated to him are located in Charlotte County.
Residents of Charlotte County were heavily involved in the American Revolution.  County delegates supported resolutions against the Stamp Act of 1765,[4] and the county government was the second governing body to declare independence from English rule.[3]  In addition, Charlotte militia units fought under General Robert Lawson during the Yorktown campaign, which effectively led to the end of the American War of Independence.[4]  Finally, the final resting place and national memorial to revolutionary hero Patrick Henry is at Red Hill Plantation.[6]

At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">Second World War</link> Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election.

Originally known as Norton Pool and Cannock Chase Reservoir, it was created as a canal feeder reservoir in 1797.[3] The reservoir was created to directly supply the Wyrley and Essington Canal and maintain levels in the 160-mile <link wikipedia="Birmingham_Canal_Navigations" osm="24277266 6421867" type="way relation">Birmingham Canal Network</link>. During a period of great industrial growth in the Black Country region the maintenance of water levels in canal infrastructure was essential and Chasewater was in great demand. As canals became less essential for transport of goods during the mid-20th century, the reservoir diversified and became a popular public amenity with activities such as water-skiing, sailing, wakeboarding and cycling. Chasewater is the third largest reservoir by volume in the county of Staffordshire and the largest canal feeder reservoir in the <link wikipedia="West_Midlands_(region)" osm="151283" type="relation">West Midlands</link>.

      <p id="GL104_383_002" num_links="2">Chatsworth is a large formerly Indian township created by the apartheid government in the 1950s[citation needed] to segregate the predominantly Indian population and create a buffer between the white suburbs to the north and the black townships to the south. The township is situated in South <link wikipedia="Durban" osm="27564996" type="node">Durban</link> basin in <link wikipedia="South_Africa" osm="424298167 87565 1252792" type="node relation relation">South Africa</link> and is roughly bordered by the Umhlatuzana River in the North and Umlaas River in the South.

      <p id="GL104_383_003" num_links="2">In the 1940s, the Pegging Acts and the Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act, 1946 were passed. These acts gave the government the right to remove and destroy shacks and small self-made shelters, with the putative intention of improving sanitary conditions.  To assist in the negotiations between the Indian People and the then apartheid government, Sargent Pradesh Beni was implemented as a spokesperson.  However, he instead claimed hectares of Land for himself in the greater Arena Park area of Central Chatsworth and enslaved many other Indian Families. As the Governors did not monitor Beni`s Actions, he ruled with an iron fist for many a year. There are even rumours that his descendants still live within the township today.  This led to the Group Areas Act of June 1950 being enforced directly by the Government, in which certain residential areas were designated for Whites, Indians, Coloureds, and Africans only. Indians were removed from areas such as Mayville, <link wikipedia="Cato_Manor" osm="262704618" type="node">Cato Manor</link>, Clairwood, Magazine Barracks, Bluff, Riverside, Prospect Hall, Duikerfontein, and Sea Cow Lake.
