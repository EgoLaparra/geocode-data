It is registered as a Zona Especial de Protecção (a Special Protection Area) and also classified as a Sitio de Interesse Público (Site of Public Interest).[1][2][3]

</p>
      <p id="GL105_100_002" num_links="2">The site was identified and first excavated by António Inácio Marques da Costa in 1906. More recently, Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares of the Museu de Arqueologia e Etnografia do Distrito de Setúbal (Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography of Setúbal District--MOADS) have been excavating and studying the site. The geographical location of the Castro is surrounded by good agricultural land and is close to the sea and several rivers, including  the <link wikipedia="Sado_River" osm="4576911" type="relation">River Sado estuary</link>, which was likely an important source of food. The first phase of development took place from the Copper Age until the early Bronze Age (about 2000 BCE). The occupants practised agriculture and livestock rearing, although hunting and gathering of molluscs from the nearby sea were also carried out. It is thought that the Castro’s dead were buried in the nearby necropolis known as the <link wikipedia="Artificial_caves_of_Casal_do_Pardo" osm="1191138578" type="node">Artificial caves of Casal do Pardo</link>. After a period of abandonment of around 1700 years the Chibanes site was again used as a place of residence during the Iron Age (3rd-2nd century BCE) and during the Roman occupation of Portugal, when the province of Lusitania formed part of the Roman Empire. It was subsequently the site of an Islamic castle during the 12th century AD during the Almohad period of the Muslim occupation of Portugal, when it was known as Alcaria.[2][3][4]

      <p id="GL105_232_002" num_links="2">The Catawba were among the East Coast tribes who made selective alliances with some of the early European colonists, when these colonists agreed to help them in their ongoing conflicts with other tribes in the region. These were primarily the tribes of different language families: the Iroquois, who ranged south from the Great Lakes area and New York; the Algonquian Shawnee and Lenape (Delaware); and the Iroquoian Cherokee, who fought for control over the large <link wikipedia="Ohio_River" osm="2182501" type="relation">Ohio Valley</link> (including what is in present-day <link wikipedia="West_Virginia" osm="317006365 162068" type="node relation">West Virginia</link>).[3] During the American Revolutionary War the Catawba supported the American colonists against the British. Decimated by colonial smallpox epidemics, warfare and cultural disruption, the Catawba declined markedly in number in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some Catawba continued to live in their homelands in South Carolina, while others joined the Choctaw or Cherokee, at least temporarily.

In 1534, during the reign of Henry VIII, the Church of England split from Rome, and Catholic worship was outlawed. Until the 18th century, Catholics faced fines, loss of property and social exclusion, and Catholic priests were hunted down, imprisoned and martyred. The main landowners in Sheffield were the Dukes of Norfolk, and the Shrewsbury Chapel in the now Anglican parish church remained Catholic until 1933. During the reordering of St Mary's in 1970, at the invitation of the Anglican Cathedral, Mass was celebrated on the altar of the Shrewsbury Chapel once again. The Altar still retains its Catholic consecration crosses, and relics, making this possible.[1] Mass was celebrated in a few houses of gentry in Sheffield, including in a house on Fargate that belonged to the Duke of Norfolk, which had a hidden chapel in its roof.[2]

      <p id="GL105_338_002" num_links="2">The cathedral square was founded as late as 19th century, during the reconstruction and refurbishment of the cathedral. Previously, the area was densely populated and built up with medieval and renaissance houses. Parts of the area were also occupied by the Lower Castle. Following the creation of a new square it became the main open space of the city's centre. It was there that the Russian military parades were held and where the annual St. Casimir's Fair was held. In 1905 a monument to <link wikipedia="Catherine_the_Great" osm="1360966298" type="node">Catherine the Great</link> (by Mark Antokolski) was erected. After the city was occupied by Germany in 1915 and the local Polish administration was allowed to govern the city, the monument was destroyed and the St. Casimir's Fair was moved to the Łukiszki Square (<link wikipedia="Lukiškės_Square" osm="1469436" type="relation">Lukiškės Square</link>). In modern times, fairs and festivities are regularly held at the site. It is there that the  tallest Christmas tree in the city is erected, as well as a number of other Christmas decorations, including outdoor nativity scenes.[1] It is also there that the yearly public celebrations of New Year's Eve are held.

Originally the church was a basilica and beside it was a chapel dedicated to Saint Arsenius, first bishop of Corfu (876-952) who came from Bithynia of Judea. The temple was destroyed in 1718 by a fire caused by an explosion of gunpowder and the place was built a smaller temple whom was no longer belonging to the Catholic Diocese. The Greek Orthodox Church also built a small chapel inside the fortress dedicated to Saint Arsenius. Today there is no trace of these temples.[1]

The patron of both churches was the Czech king; in 1310 the king Henry of Bohemia (1265-1335) bestowed the patronal right upon the Teutonic Order. However, the same year, the king was banished from the Czech country and the Order didn't dare to take hold of their right. The Teutonic Order finally enforced this right from John of Bohemia (1296-1346) in 1322. However, next problem arose with the conflict over a presbytery with the Church of All Saints, resulting in favour of the Teutonic Order in 1342. The takeover of the clergy houses therefore probably became the motive for the initiation of the church construction. The Teutonic Order remained its patron until 1546, when the city of Pilsen got the abovementioned patronal right. The Diecese of Pilsner was established by <link wikipedia="Pope_John_Paul_II" osm="320953156 2021754742 5635848333 6410437520" type="node node node node">John Paul II</link>  on 31 May 1993, and then the parish church became a cathedral, the urban church of the <link wikipedia="Bishop" osm="96907196" type="node">bishop</link>.

It was consecrated by Bishop Luka Zhidiata (1035–1060) on September 14, in 1050 or 1052, the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross. (A fresco just inside the south entrance depicts Sts. Constantine and Helena, who found the true cross in the fourth century; it is one of the oldest works of art in the cathedral and is thought to commemorate its dedication.)[2]  While it is commonly known as St. Sophia's, it is not named for any of the female saints of that name (i.e., Sophia of Rome or Sophia the Martyr); rather, the name comes from the Greek for wisdom (Σoφíα, from whence we get words like philosophia or philosophy—"the love of wisdom"), and thus Novgorod's cathedral is dedicated to the Holy Wisdom of God, in imitation of the <link wikipedia="Hagia_Sophia" osm="109862851 1555271" type="way relation">Hagia Sophia</link> cathedral of Constantinople. It replaced an even older wooden, 13-domed church built in or around 989 by Bishop Ioakim Korsunianin, the first bishop of Novgorod.  The main, golden cupola, was gilded by Archbishop Ioann (1388–1415) in 1408.  The sixth (and the largest) dome crowns a tower which leads to the upper galleries.

As of 2004, it housed some 5,000 volumes.[4]  A Sunday school is also held in the gallery.[5]

      <p id="GL105_482_002" num_links="3">Catholic Cemetery was established by the Archdiocese of Mobile on December 18, 1848 when the first acreage was purchased north of Three Mile Creek by Bishop Michael Portier.  It was founded to serve the needs of Mobile's <link wikipedia="Catholic_Church" osm="618656792" type="way">Roman Catholic</link> citizens after the Catholic section of <link wikipedia="Church_Street_Graveyard" osm="319050242" type="way">Church Street Graveyard</link> was filled to capacity after various yellow fever epidemics struck the city in the 1830s.[1] The 1848 section covers 5 acres (2.0 ha) and features an unusual design consisting of three large concentric rings, instead of the more typical east-west configuration.  The circular design surrounds a square plot dedicated to the Daughters of Charity, with a large marble monument in the center commemorating their sacrifices during a yellow fever outbreak in 1853.  It was platted in this manner under the direction of Portier and was possibly executed by Claude Beroujon, who designed Mobile's <link wikipedia="Cathedral_Basilica_of_the_Immaculate_Conception_(Mobile,_Alabama)" osm="362985736" type="way">Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception</link> a decade earlier.
