A two-room structure on Bradley Lane in Chevy Chase served residents from 1898 until 1917, when the Chevy Chase School – the first Chevy Chase School in a permanent building – was constructed.[2]  In that year, a two-story brick building was built on Rosemary Street by a contractor named Roy W. Poole of Frederick, Maryland, at a cost of $20,000 in county funds. In 1930, a 12-classroom brick building designed by Howard Wright Cutler was added to the Chevy Chase School for $94,000.[6]  In 1936, nine classrooms were added for $103,000 to the west wing. With this addition, the original 1917 structure was demolished. To connect the new buildings, a “Long Hall” was added. This “Long Hall” connected the two buildings to each other, but only from the first floor. This hall did not contain any insulation and was known as unstable.

In the north, in the area bordering Tabasco, near <link wikipedia="Teapa_Municipality" osm="5961550" type="relation">Teapa</link>, rainfall can average more than 3,000 mm (120 in) per year. In the past, natural vegetation in this region was lowland, tall perennial rainforest, but this vegetation has been almost completely cleared to allow agriculture and ranching. Rainfall decreases moving towards the <link wikipedia="Pacific_Ocean" osm="305640005" type="node">Pacific Ocean</link>, but it is still abundant enough to allow the farming of bananas and many other tropical crops near Tapachula. On the several parallel "sierras" or mountain ranges running along the center of Chiapas, climate can be quite temperate and foggy, allowing the development of cloud forests like those of the Reserva de la Biosfera el Triunfo, home to a handful of resplendent quetzals and horned guans.

Although it was annexed by the city of Chicago in 1889, it remained mostly farmland with some scattered settlements until the 1920s. Between 1920 and 1930 the population increased from 14,000 to 47,000.

Most new residents belonged to various Protestant denominations, but Chicago Lawn also was home to many Roman Catholic churches and schools. Today, there are six Catholic institutions that make up the Marquette Park Catholic Campus Council. Chicago Lawn was a thriving urban neighborhood as the Depression hit the nation and by 1940 its population had reached 49,291. In 1941, the National Biscuit Company announced plans to build a huge bakery in Chicago Lawn. When completed, this was the largest bakery in one location in the world. The size of the facility was doubled in the late 1990s.

The castle at Chichester was one of 11 fortified sites to be established in Sussex before 1100. The Rape of Chichester, a subdivision of Sussex, was administered from the castle and was split off from the larger Rape of <link wikipedia="Arundel" osm="2960986" type="relation">Arundel</link>; a Rape was an administrative unit originating in the Saxon era and continued by the Normans.[2] Situated in the north-east corner of Chichester, the castle was protected by the city walls. As it was an urban castle inserted into a pre-existing settlement, buildings were probably cleared to make way for the castle. Chichester Castle was of timber construction; although some timber castles were rebuilt in stone, there is no evidence that this was the case at Chichester Castle.[3]

      <p id="GL107_372_002" num_links="3">Although originally built by the Earl of Shrewsbury, the Earls of Sussex owned the castle in the period 1154–1176, after which it passed into possession of the Crown.[1] Early in the 13th century, Chichester Castle was used as a court and jail. Chichester and <link wikipedia="Oxford_Castle" osm="29089712" type="way">Oxford Castle</link> were some of the earliest urban castles to be used for this purpose, but gradually most urban castles were also used in this way.[4] In 1216, the castle, along with many others in southern England, such as <link wikipedia="Reigate_Castle" osm="606175083" type="node">Reigate Castle</link>, was captured by the French. This was part of the  First Barons' War against King John of England (1199–1216). The castle was recaptured by the English in the spring of 1217.[3] In the same year, Henry III ordered the castle's destruction.[1] Between 1222 and 1269, Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, gave the site to the order of Greyfriars for them use as the site of a friary.

      <p id="GL107_446_002" num_links="2">Dr. E.E. Speaker and the Lake View Commercial Club sought to have the statue created in 1932 in conjunction with the effort to establish Black Hawk State Park on the shore of what was then named Wall Lake.  Harry E. Stinson, a sculptor and associate professor at the <link wikipedia="University_of_Iowa" osm="1579426" type="relation">University of Iowa</link>, was chosen to create the statue.  After choosing Crescent Park as the location of the statue, Stinson created a 3-foot (0.91 m) model based on the body of a university student and the face of Moses Slick, a Native American from <link wikipedia="Tama,_Iowa" osm="151533196 128343" type="node relation">Tama, Iowa</link>.  The project became the foundation for the Public Works of Art Project in Iowa, which was funded by the Civil Works Administration, a New Deal program during the Great Depression.  Based on this project, the University of Iowa created guidelines for other towns in the state who wanted to participate in the program.[2]  The city of Lake View also contributed to the effort, and the Civilian Conservation Corps prepared and landscaped the site.  The statue was dedicated on September 3, 1934, Labor Day, in a ceremony where the name of the lake was changed from Wall Lake to Black Hawk Lake.   The finished statue is slightly different from the model with the features being narrower and sharper.  It references Charles Bird King's painting of Black Hawk from in 1837.  The statue was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.[1]
