      <p id="GL108_004_001" num_links="3">With Canadian Confederation in 1867, a variety of canal-building projects were undertaken throughout the new country by the new federal government, including renewed interest in a canal that could transit the isthmus at Chignecto. The Chignecto Ship Railway project was first proposed in 1875 by notable civil engineer Henry Ketchum as a means to transport ships across the Isthmus of Chignecto, shortening the sailing distance between the <link wikipedia="Bay_of_Fundy" osm="9486906" type="relation">Bay of Fundy</link> and the <link wikipedia="Gulf_of_Saint_Lawrence" osm="305639440 9428957" type="node relation">Gulf of St. Lawrence</link> by avoiding the necessity of sailing 500 nmi (930 km) around Nova Scotia.  A canal had been proposed for the isthmus but financing was proving difficult to secure.  Ketchum submitted his proposal to the Government of Canada in 1881.  In 1882 the Chignecto Marine Transport Railway Company was incorporated as a federally chartered railway.  It was financed by Baring Brothers and Company, <link wikipedia="London" osm="107775 65606" type="node relation">London</link>.

Soon after, the construction of a small plaza was initiated, and according to the Dominican religious order and local sources, the plaza's Templo del Espíritu Santo ("Holy Spirit temple") along with its domes and lateral cover was not begun until 1739. The design of the temple is quite interesting, with two angels in feathered nightwear and their arms lifted vertically, separated by twelve fringes of rectangular flowers which add to the whole decoration of the temple. Cherubs also decorate the circular cornice, along with four saints in full-length reliefs that occupy the "pechinas" of the columns that sustain the temple's dome, which is considered one of the most original works of the colony and now visited by occasional tourists.

Designed by native artists Kazuo Kikuchi and Kiyoshi Ikebe, the monument was built using money derived from a fund-raising campaign by Japanese school children, including Sadako Sasaki's classmates, with the main statue entitled "Atomic Bomb Children". The statue was unveiled on 5 May 1958, the Japanese Children's Day holiday. Sadako Sasaki, who died of an atomic bomb disease radiation poisoning is immortalized at the top of the statue, where she holds a wire crane above her head. Shortly before she passed, she had a vision to create a thousand cranes. Japanese tradition says that if one creates a thousand cranes, they are granted one wish.  Sadako's wish was to have a world without nuclear weapons. Thousands of origami cranes from all over the world are offered around the monument. They serve as a sign that the children who make them and those who visit the statue desire a world without nuclear war, having been tied to the statue by the story that Sadako died from radiation-induced leukemia after folding just under a thousand cranes, wishing for world peace. However, an exhibit which appeared in the <link wikipedia="Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Museum" osm="9521566" type="relation">Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum</link> stated that by the end of August 1955, Sadako had achieved her goal and continued to fold more cranes.

Ordered in 1579 to establish a city at the site by Governor Rodrigo de Quiroga, Martin Ruiz de Gamboa founded the city on June 25, 1580 after replacing Quiroga as governor following his death.  He gave it the name San Bartolomé de Chillán y Gamboa and populated it with 50 Spaniards and 60 more in the fort. It suffered a number of attacks before it was destroyed by the Mapuche in 1599 after the Disaster of Curalaba.  Governor Francisco de Quiñónez immediately repaired it in April 1599.  Later, in 1655, the same Mapuche and the neighboring Pehuenches forced the citizens to abandon it again.  When it was again reoccupied, it was demolished by an earthquake on March 15, 1657. It was repopulated again in 1663, under Ángel de Saldia. The earthquake of May 25, 1751, that ruined old <link wikipedia="Penco" osm="1614637" type="relation">Concepcion</link>, also damaged the city, aggravated considerably by a simultaneous extraordinary flooding of the Chillán River.  This forced its transfer two years later to the site that it occupies today.

      <p id="GL108_315_001" num_links="2">Although different technology existed during the Post-classic and Colonial periods in the basin, chinampas have raised many questions on agricultural production and political development. After the Aztec Triple Alliance formed, the conquest of southern basin city-states, such as <link wikipedia="Xochimilco" osm="3114156398 5606640" type="node relation">Xochimilco</link>, was one of the first strategies of imperial expansion.

Chinampas were invented by the Aztec civilization. Sometimes referred to as "floating gardens," chinampas are artificial islands that were created by interweaving reeds with stakes beneath the lake's surface, creating underwater fences.[1] A buildup of soil and aquatic vegetation would be piled into these "fences" until the top layer of soil was visible on the water's surface.[1] These agricultural lands received this nickname due to the illusion they caused. The bodies of land appeared to be "floating" on the water because the canals surrounded the chinampa plots.[2]
