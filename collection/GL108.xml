The roughly rectangular plot is set off from its surroundings by a stone wall on three sides, with a line of mature sugar maples just inside the walls, and running along the fourth side.  The walls at one time had wooden fencing mounted on them, but this has been removed.  Movement within the cemetery is via a turf cart path that skirts its perimeter, just inside the line of trees, and a series of paths laid out in a grid.  Most of the over 600 stones are marble, with most of the rest made of granite.  Many of the granite markers are made from stone quarried in nearby <link wikipedia="Goshen,_Massachusetts" osm="158857496" type="node">Goshen</link>, and a number of them bear the marks of locally known stone carvers.

In 2004 it underwent renovation work.[1] It was devised at the time as a specially fine model for municipal structures of this sort. On the sides is inscribed the Catalan word for "market", mercat. Its floor is an irregular quadrilateral, and its basement included originally an ice factory which, however, was closed at the onset of the Republic because the former government didn't pay for its costs.[2]

A society they formed in that year to encourage Methodism's growth and outreach survives.  Local Methodist worshipper and historian Carlos Crisford designed the lavish church in 1907, and it has been used for worship ever since—even as several other Methodist churches in the town and surrounding villages have declined and closed.

      <p id="GL108_273_002" num_links="3">The history of the park goes back to the emergence of civil settlements around the fortification of Verniy and the development of fisheries. For the first time, the park was laid as a state garden by a  scientist-gardener G. Krishtopenko in 1856; in the floodplain of the Malaya Almatinka river, as a place for walking and resting officers of the Vernensky garrison. Krishtopenko, who had experience in the <link wikipedia="Crimea" osm="7750160" type="relation">Crimea</link>, planted the first deciduous and coniferous trees in the garden. For his work, Krishtopenko drew lovers of gardening-vernentsev Kutaberdin, Sergeev, Chvanov and others. After studying the climatic conditions and the structure of the soil, Krishtopenko came to the conclusion that not only Central Asian plants, but also species characteristic of Central Russia could grow in the garden, as well as in the entire fortification of the city. In 1868, the seedlings and the seeds were delivered to Verniy from the <link wikipedia="Nikitsky_Botanical_Garden" osm="2499193602 25499979" type="node way">Nikitsky Botanical Garden</link>, and the Penza School of Horticulture in <link wikipedia="Tashkent" osm="27524773 2216724" type="node relation">Tashkent</link>.[4]

Originally, the entire area of the park was that area around Patterson Creek. In the 1890s, work began on landscaping the area. Clemow Avenue was constructed, blocking the creek and creating the open space of the park. The work on the park was completed in 1907. In the 1960s, the city proposed extending Carling Avenue through the park to the canal. This caused an outcry in the community and led to the creation of the Glebe Community Association. Eventually, the plans were shelved.

The bandstand was built in 1913 following a series of successful outdoor concerts in the park. Local engineer J. C. Ericson built the structure in the then-recently popularized bandshell form, which projected sound toward the audience through its rear wall. The bandstand was completed in three weeks; its opening concert hosted the largest crowd that the park had ever held until that time. From its inception until 1925, the bandstand continued to host concerts, usually once per week; movie screenings and church services were also held at the bandstand. Beginning in 1947, the bandstand became an event stage for the Midwest Corn Show, which later became the Orion Fall Festival; the structure is now mainly used during the festival.[2]

However, with the introduction of rail transportation and steamships, increasing quantity of post quickly made the building insufficient.

On its inauguration in the mid-1870s, the new building was well-dimensioned for its purpose, but before the end of the century explosive volumes of postcards had made the headquarters outdated again and in 1896 a decision was taken to move into a larger building.[3]

The natural and geographic features of this region create conditions for industrial activities and more than a third of gross value added is still generated by manufacturing, mining, and other industry. In 2013, the region once again recorded the highest negative annual population growth rate (−11.9‰), which was mainly a result of migration to other statistical regions. Among all statistical regions in 2013, this region had the highest negative net migration between regions; namely, −9.5. This region also stands out by age of mothers at childbirth.
In 2013 first-time mothers in the region were on average 28.5 years old, whereas first-time mothers in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region were on average 1 year older. In the same year, the number of unemployed persons increased further. The registered unemployment rate was among the highest in the country (16.6%). In comparison with other regions, this is 7 percentage points more than in the region with the lowest registered unemployment rate, <link wikipedia="Upper_Carniola_Statistical_Region" osm="1699230" type="relation">Upper Carniola</link>, and almost 1 percentage point less than in the region with the highest unemployment rate, the <link wikipedia="Mura_Statistical_Region" osm="1703918" type="relation">Mura Statistical Region</link>.

The following year an act of the legislature renamed it the Central Kentucky Lunatic Asylum. In late 1887, it received its own post office, called simply "Asylum". The following year its name was changed to "Lakeland", and the institution was commonly referred to as "Lakeland Hospital" or "Lakeland Asylum". By 1900, its official name had been changed to the Central Kentucky Asylum for the Insane.  By 1912 it was known as Central State Hospital. Comparable institutions are Eastern State Hospital at Lexington in Fayette County and Western State Hospital at Hopkinsville, Christian County, Kentucky.

It was later extended to the western suburb of Ealing. After the Second World War, the line was expanded considerably into the recently constructed suburbs, taking over steam-hauled outer-suburban routes to the borders of London and beyond to the east. This realised plans that had been delayed by the war, when construction stopped and the unused tunnels were used as air-raid shelters and factories. However, suburban growth proved to be less than expected, and of the planned expansions one (to Denham, Buckinghamshire) was cut short due to its location in the Metropolitan Green Belt and another (to <link wikipedia="Ongar_railway_station" osm="2376594758" type="node">Ongar</link>) ultimately closed in 1994 due to low patronage; the section between Epping and Ongar later became part of the <link wikipedia="Epping_Ongar_Railway" osm="147290383 165230" type="way relation">Epping Ongar Railway</link>.

      <p id="GL108_433_001" num_links="4">Maritime education started in the Faroe Islands by private institutions in late 19th century. Two skippers Jens Mohr and Jens í Dali established two maritime schools (skipper schools) in Tórshavn in 1893. In 1896 Dánjal í Ungagarði established a skipper's school in <link wikipedia="Porkeri" osm="29023787 2181486" type="node relation">Porkeri</link> and Hans Djurholm started a skippers school in <link wikipedia="Glyvrar" osm="29023740 2529860" type="node relation">Glyvrar</link> in <link wikipedia="Eysturoy" osm="1423024" type="relation">Eysturoy</link> in 1903. The two brothers Jákup and Jógvan Joensen (they were called "Jákup and Jógvan við Stein") started their skipper's school in Tórshavn in 1904. In 1905 Jens Pauli í Dali took over his father's school in Tórshavn. All these schools were private and only open in winther time from 1 November to late February. The first maritime school which was built for the same purpose opened on 1 November 1905 by the two Danes Viggo Ryving-Jensen and Andrias Nielsen. In 1917 the exams became both oral and in writing. In 1925 Faroese fishermen went to <link wikipedia="Greenland" osm="424312026 2184073" type="node relation">Greenland</link> to fish, but the problem was that the education of the skippers and the first mates on the Faroese fishing boats only permitted them to steer and maneuvre a boat or ship around the Faroe Island and not as far as in the waters near Greenland. Faroese authorities therefore asked Danish authorities for help. In 1927 Danish authorities established a Maritime school in Tórshavn. They restored the school building, Sjómansskúlin, of Ryving-Jensen and Styrmand Nielsen, which at that point had stopped teaching and used it for the new maritime educations. A Dane, H. A. Guldhammer, was the principal for the first two years, after that Jens Pauli í Dali was the principal until 1956. In 1929 the school started an education for motormen.[1]
