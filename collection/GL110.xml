During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, Japanese forces landed at Chongjin, and established a supply base due to its proximity to the front lines in Manchuria. The Japanese remained after the end of the war, and in 1908, declared the city an open trading port both for transport of Korean resources and as a stopping point for resources from China.[2] The city was known during this period as “Seishin”, after the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese characters for its name. The Imperial Japanese Army’s 19th Division was headquartered in Ranam from 1918, where the Japanese built a new planned city based on a rectangular street grid.[1] In the 1930, <link wikipedia="Nippon_Steel" osm="4634759102" type="node">Nippon Steel</link> built a large steel mill, the Seishin Iron and Steel Works, in the town. Ranam was annexed to Chongjin in 1940, which was elevated to city status. The city was overrun after a brief resistance by the Soviet Union on 13 August 1945, only two days before the end of <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>.
Under the rule of North Korea, Chongjin remained an important military and industrial centre. It was directly administered by the central government from 1960-1967 and from 1977-1988.

Literally translated, the church's full name was the Church of the Holy Saviour in the Country:  although "The Church of the Holy Redeemer in the Fields" would be a more natural rendering of the name in English.  (Greek ἡ Ἐκκλησία τοῦ Ἁγίου Σωτῆρος ἐν τῇ Χώρᾳ, hē Ekklēsia tou Hagiou Sōtēros en tēi Chōrai).[2] The last part of that name, Chora, referring to its location originally outside of the walls, became the shortened name of the church. The original church on this site was built in the early 4th century, and stood outside of the 4th century walls of Constantine the Great. However, when Theodosius II built his formidable land walls in 413–414, the church became incorporated within the city's defences, but retained the name Chora. The name must have carried symbolic meaning, as the mosaics in the narthex describe Christ as the Land of the Living (ἡ Χώρα τῶν ζώντων, hē Chōra tōn zōntōn) and <link wikipedia="Mary,_mother_of_Jesus" osm="2363258019 6262336190" type="node node">Mary, the Mother of Jesus</link>, as the Container of the Uncontainable (ἡ Χώρα τοῦ Ἀχωρήτου, hē Chōra tou Achōrētou).

This was his daily practice. Maharani becoming suspicious of his absence and questioned the king. The king revealed everything in detail. She having made up her mind to test the king compelled him to take her also with him. The king reluctantly accepted. The next day, he took her to Kasi along with him. Rani had her monthly course during their stay at Kasi. This affected the king and he lost his Mantra Shakti. As he was unable to return to his kingdom as usual, the King became restless and worried.

      <p id="GL110_366_002" num_links="3">The ancient Cinque Port and fishing town of Hastings evolved into a seaside resort in the 19th century.  The arrival of two separate railway routes from London (one via Lewes, the other via Tunbridge Wells)[2] and improved road links helped this; the population doubled from about 11,000 a few years before these developments to 23,000 20 years later.[3]  The town, previously focused around the seafront area, grew inland, and <link wikipedia="Ore_Valley" osm="356908177" type="node">Ore</link>—a small linear village on the road to <link wikipedia="Rye,_East_Sussex" osm="2510480" type="node">Rye</link>—was gradually absorbed into the urban area.  It was first recorded in the early 12th century, although its Anglo-Saxon name (derived from ora, meaning a ridge or slope) suggests earlier settlement, and a parish church was built on high ground to the northwest, near Ore <link wikipedia="Manor_house" osm="681158254" type="way">manor house</link>, in the 12th century.[4]  There were a few cottages around it until the mid-19th century,[5] but by that time the focus of Ore's development had moved decisively to the area around the main road and Fairlight Down (assisted by the construction of a barracks at Halton and the conversion of the road to turnpike status).[6]

The bronze rails in the brick wall were added for public viewing in 1858 by parties working at the behest of the Franklin Institute, which assumed the responsibility of defending Franklin's historic ties to Philadelphia after prominent Bostonians criticized the city's maintenance of the grave and erected a Franklin statue there.[2] Leaving pennies on Franklin's grave is an old Philadelphia tradition.

The building was completed, and on April 12, 1831, the <link wikipedia="University_of_Alabama" osm="89748187" type="way">University of Alabama</link> held charter ceremonies here. Additions and changes to the church building have taken place over the years: in 1882 the building was enlarged and remodeled from Greek Revival to Gothic Revival style, and the bell tower was added. An organ was installed in 1830 when the building was finished, but in 1941 the console was moved from the south to the north side of the chancel. The parish hall and rectory were begun in 1906, but in 1952 the old rectory was torn down and ground was broken for the chapel and education building. In 1984 a narthex was added on the west end of the nave to protect the church from street noise, and at the same time, a cloistered walk was built from the education building and the bell tower. Today Christ Church is the oldest church in the diocese. Thirty-five stained glass windows add colorful inspiration to the buildings on the property: seventeen in the main church, eight in the parish hall, six in the chapel, four in the narthex and a domed ceiling in the chancel. The Rev. William H. Judd was the first priest to serve Christ Church.
