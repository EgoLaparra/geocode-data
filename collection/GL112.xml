The oldest material traces of a religious building on the site date back to the 10th century. Three churches preceding the current construction were identified during excavations carried out in 1967. The current building was built between 1750 and 1753 in a classical style, by an anonymous architect.[2] The brick and limestone church is quite homogeneous. It's composed of six bayed naves flanked by aisles, a three-sided transept and a choir with a polygonal ambulatory with a sacristy in its axis. The chamfered base is in dimension stone on the frontage, in rubble stones and sandstone for the rest. All the angles of the building are toothed and every second stone is bossed. The church has been listed as a Belgian cultural heritage site since 1949.

The church burned down in a great fire of Sarajevo in 1879.[1] Another building was constructed in 1881, but it was small and humble, made almost entirely of wood and adobe. As the only Catholic church in the city, it was ceded by the Bosnian Franciscans to the first Archbishop of Vrhbosna Josip Štadler, who used it as his residence from 1881 until the consecration of the <link wikipedia="Sacred_Heart_Cathedral,_Sarajevo" osm="474428386" type="way">Sacred Heart Cathedral</link> in 1889. The old church was returned to the Franciscan friars. It was not, however, built to endure for long. By 1905, it had deteriorated to the point where it had to be closed.[1][3]

The Capucines were granted to do missionary work in Belgrade on 23 August 1718, by the Emperor's decision. They were given one of the mosques which they adapted and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. On the city plans, their monastery is located just within the outer walls, next to the Emperor's Gate.

The Capucines had only 9 monks by 1725 which was quite insufficient for their duties. They were handling all the Catholics in the occupied area, proclaimed by the Austrian court as the Kingdom of Serbia. They also took religious care of the soldiers which were scattered over the region, but they only had 2 parochial priests. Still, they turned over 1,000 imperial soldiers from Protestantism into Catholicism. They originally took care of the ill all over Belgrade, in the fortress, existing hospitals and private houses. In the letter of an unknown city clerk from 10 November 1736, sent to the Vicar Provincial of the order in <link wikipedia="Vienna" osm="17328659 109166" type="node relation">Vienna</link>, it was mentioned that the Capucines asked for the field hospital to be established. It would take care of the soldiers and have place for 1,500 people. Military commander of Belgrade agreed, providing permanent pay and food for the monks who would treat the soldiers. There was enough space next to their monastery for such a facility. Still, the care of the soldiers was first offered to the Jesuits, but they refused. Names of two especially dedicated Capucine priests are preserved in the documents: Father Oswaldus and Father Chrysogonus.[1]

After the fire in 1737, from 1738–1748, architect Johann Christoph Glaubitz completely reconstructed the church in style of late Baroque. During the 1827-28 reconstruction, architect Karol Podczaszynski destroyed the bulk of the sumptuous Baroque interior - nearly 3000 carts with splinters of altars, sculptures and stucco works were taken to a dump; chapels suffered the least. In the Soviet times the church was closed down and severely damaged. During Hitler's occupation, the Reverend Alfonsas Lipniūnas, who was later imprisoned by the Nazis in the Stutthof camp and perished, delivered rebellious sermons in the church. In 1979 a university museum was founded there. In 1991 the church was returned to its parishioners.

The original church building survives today, being used as the cemetery chapel, making it one of the oldest surviving churches in Scarborough. The land for the church was donated to Bishop John Strachan and the Anglican Diocese of Toronto by Patrick and Ann Parkin. They had used this corner of their farm as a family cemetery. The church was built atop a small hill, so that it dominated the surrounding landscape. The still operational cemetery surrounds the church, and has graves dating back to 1832. Local farmers built the church with lumber milled from nearby trees. The Gothic revival structure was designed by Reverend William Darling, the Anglican minister for Scarborough township. It is a replica in miniature of a church he remembered from his native Scotland. Keeping the proportions of the original while greatly shrinking the structure explains why the sacristy entrance is only five feet high. Darling's son, Frank Darling, would later become a prominent Toronto architect himself.

The building was constructed on a property consisting of eight city lots donated by George W. Pine.[3]

During the 1655-61 war with Moscow the Cossacks burned down and ravaged the church; it was renovated in 1663-73. A Baroque belfry was built in the 1st quarter of the 18th century. The church was closed down by the tsarist authorities in 1888, and in 1905 returned to Sapiehas, renovated in 1905-12. In 1933 both the church and monastery were renovated again (under supervision by Stanislaw Lorentz). In 1972-2006 the Museum of Architecture operated in the church.

The original church plan was begun in 1861 and completed in 1868, with a front on 31st Street, between 9th and 10th Avenues. The church was built in phases surrounding the chapel and without disturbing services there. When finally completed according to the original plans, it was 80 feet (24 m) wide by 200 feet (61 m) long and had a stone facade and 105-foot (32 m) high tower on 31st Street and an interior nuns' gallery on two sides. It was designed by the founding pastor, Arthur J. Donnelly (1820–1890), and architect T.S. Wall.  The church complex also consisted of a rectory, convent and schools, the latter designed by architect Lawrence J. O'Connor, FAIA. During 1874–1884, the complex was the original home of the Presentation Sisters in the northeastern United States, and enrollment grew to become the largest parochial schools in New York.

      <p id="GL112_141_002" num_links="2">The church was founded in 13th century[1]. Le Rond means 'round' from the shape of the bell tower which was elevated in 1728. In 1791, one of the bells was given to St. Florence's Church [fr] in <link wikipedia="Paron,_Yonne" osm="945544" type="relation">Paron</link>.
At the time of the French Revolution, the priest escaped from the church, disguised as a carter. Two citizens from Sens, Macé and Thomas, managed to buy the church and so saved the building from revolutionary fury. They said to authorities that they would transform it as a fodder barn. In fact they saved all the stained glass windows and furniture.
After the Revolution, they sold it back to the priest, Fr. Rupier, who gave it to the <link wikipedia="Sens_Cathedral" osm="51845053" type="way">Cathedral of Sens</link> in 1797. The church was consecrated and restored. In 1965 after Vatican II, the church was closed and never re-opened. Today it is in a desperate state. It has been registered since 1965 into Monuments historiques[2].

The present church, which combines a plain, unadorned Gothic Revival exterior with a lavishly decorated interior featuring extensive early 20th-century paintings by Nathaniel Westlake, is the third building used for Roman Catholic worship in the seaside resort.  James Burton's new town of 1827, immediately west of Hastings, was home to a convent from 1848; public worship then transferred to a new church nearby in 1866.  When this burnt down, prolific and "distinguished" architect Charles Alban Buckler designed a replacement.  The church remains in use as the main place of worship in a parish which extends into nearby Hollington, and has been listed at Grade II by English Heritage for its architectural and historical importance.

Such investments into the town's development were the result of the determination of Charles IV to enhance the City of Prague to match its new role—the capital of the Holy Roman Empire. The proof for this is the unusual shape of the church in reference to its patron. The octagonal floor plan refers directly to the main building of the imperial palace of Charles the Great in Aachen—to the <link wikipedia="Aachen_Cathedral" osm="20470246" type="way">Aachen Cathedral</link>, that was erected on the hexagonal floor plan with an inserted octagon.

The current church was built in 1894, probably on the site of an 1826 church, and likely using timbers and other elements (including one iconostasis) from the older church.  It is one of the oldest churches in Alaska, and is significant as the site from which missionaries brought their religion to the local Aleut people.  This evangelization effort was so successful that today's Aleut population is still strongly Orthodox.  The church was declared a National Historic Landmark for its architecture, and for its role in the history and culture of Alaska.[2][3]  It is the second cathedral church of the  Orthodox Church in America Diocese of Alaska, after St. Michael's Cathedral in <link wikipedia="Sitka,_Alaska" osm="1505783342 2605309" type="node relation">Sitka</link> (which is also a National Historic Landmark).

Around this time structural alterations were made to the church, with the rebuilding of the chancel and the addition of a north aisle, the aisle being shorter than the chancel.[6] During the 15th century the Norman style windows in the nave were replaced by larger Gothic style windows. The carvings of angels in the roofs of the chancel and aisle were added.  A polygonal bell-storey was built over the nave.[7]  In 1643, during the Civil War, many of the "idolatrous" images were destroyed.[8] By the 19th century the church was in a poor state of repair.  Part of the ambulatory collapsed in 1841, and the Cambridge Camden Society offered to carry out repairs.  They appointed Anthony Salvin for the purpose.[9]

Climate is moderate continental, with the average temperatures ranging from −13 °C (9 °F) in January to +19 °C (66 °F) in July. Annual precipitation varies between 450 and 700 millimeters (18 and 28 in), but is uneven from one year to another. Natural resources include gypsum, sand, clay, sapropel deposits, phosphorite, and peat. There are oil and natural gas deposits, although their extraction has not yet been commercially pursued. Forests, mostly in the south along the Sura River, cover approximately 30% of the land.[14]

The first lighthouse, lit on 24 May 1910, was a red metal skeletal tower, built under the supervision of Alfred Kurt Schultze. The lantern was equipped with the 4 th order of Fresnel lens built by Barbier, Benard, et Turenne emitting a white and red light with a range of 18 nautical miles (33 km; 21 mi). In 1934 the skeletal tower was in poor conditions due to the corrosion, it was decided to build a new concrete tower, but some years later it was abandoned because of the instability of the foundation. The current light, built in 1941, is a tapered cylindrical concrete tower, 30 metres (98 ft) high, with double balcony and lantern; the tower is painted with red and white horizontal bands. The lantern emits  two white flashes every 25 seconds visible up to 46 nautical miles (85 km; 53 mi).
