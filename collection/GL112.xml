</p>
      <p id="GL112_034_002" num_links="2">The chapel was most likely constructed before 1326, when it was part of the castle complex.[3] In the 14th century, it was a single-story building with a crypt. It possessed a nave, as well as a polygonal presbytery, which was contained within the circumference of the castle's defensive walls. In 1407, the chapel was rebuilt in the gothic style by order of King <link wikipedia="Władysław_II_Jagiełło" osm="2519995" type="relation">Ladislaus II Jagiello</link> (Jogaila of Lithuania). After increasing the height of the walls, the chapel became a two-story structure, maintaining the old crypt. The form of the church was dominated by two steep step-patterned gables which survived until the 1650s. The lowest level of the building was designated as a crypt for deceased chaplains and local administrators, while the upper levels were used for religious services. The polygonal presbytery as well as the square nave were rib-vaulted. The vaulting of the nave was supported by a centrally-planned pillar. This structural element was typical for the sacral and secular architecture during the reign of <link wikipedia="Casimir_III_the_Great" osm="2519994" type="relation">Casimir III the Great</link>. During the Renaissance, the church maintained a gothic character, however the entrance was positioned on the first floor (that is, one floor above ground-level) and was framed by a new Renaissance portal, made in the Komasków masonry workshop. It wasn't until the 17th century that the facade of the chapel was crested with a gable in the style of the Lublin Renaissance. During the parliamentary sessions in 1569 regarding the Union of Lublin, a holy mass was held at the Holy Trinity Chapel, asking for successful deliberations.[3]  Some of participants left inscriptions on the walls of the chapel commemorating the event.[3]

During the long recovery he was particularly helped by a young part-time nurse, Monique Bourgeois, who had answered his advertisement seeking "a young and pretty nurse".[3] Matisse asked her to pose for him, which she did for several drawings and paintings.  In 1943 Bourgeois entered the Dominican convent in Vence, a nearby town, and became Sister Jacques-Marie. Matisse eventually bought a home at Vence, not far from the convent where the young nun was stationed.  She visited him and told him of the plans the Dominicans had to build a chapel beside the girls' high school which they operated in Vence.  She asked Matisse if he would help with the design of the chapel.  He had never done anything like it, but Matisse agreed to help, beginning in 1947. Father Marie-Alain Couturier, who collaborated on several artistic Catholic churches after World War II, was also involved in the project.

Lake Murray separates Chapin from the rest of Lexington County.

Chapin was founded by Martin Chapin in 1889. The following year, 1890, the railroad was built to connect Chapin to <link wikipedia="Columbia,_South_Carolina" osm="154020768 194000" type="node relation">Columbia, South Carolina</link> and other major regions.

Knight.  Chapin has four public schools in the area; the first Chapin school was built in 1924. Lake Murray is the main attraction to Chapin and provides recreational boaters with water-related entertainment.

      <p id="GL112_222_002" num_links="2">The area that is now the town of Charlemont was surveyed by colonists in 1736, with settlement following in the early 1740s.  It was abandoned during King George's War in the late 1740s, and resettled soon after that war ended.  The village center was the principal nexus of this early settlement, even including a grist mill on Mill Brook.  Significant population growth did not take place until the 1760s, and the town incorporated in 1765.  The village was the site of an early tavern, where the 1787 Charlemont Inn now stands; it is said that Benedict Arnold stayed there in the early days of the American Revolutionary War.  The town's economy was based on agriculture, taking advantage of the fertile floodplain of the <link wikipedia="Deerfield_River" osm="5454709" type="relation">Deerfield River</link>.

The lower Missouri River had long been used for commerce, but commercial ships largely stopped using the upper portion of the river after the railroads pushed west in the 1880s.

The dams would not only generate electricity for use by railroads and industry, but they would aid in flood prevention and create large reservoirs which could be used for commercial traffic. With the onset of the Great Depression in October 1929, unemployment became a severe problem in Montana.  The <link wikipedia="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" osm="1610589818" type="node">Franklin D.

Additional lands were turned over to the Corps on May 8, 1934 (Executive Order 6707), September 11, 1934 (Executive Order 6841), and April 3, 1936 (Executive Order 7331).[8]

The oldest section is a two-story, two-bay, gable-roofed log section. A stone, two-story, two-bay, gable-roofed section was added about 1780; the roof level, window and door openings and floor levels were subsequently raised on the original log section; and a stone, 1 1/2-story lean-to was added on the rear wall of the log section. It has been a residence since the early 20th century. It is in a vernacular Federal style. Also on the property are the contributing ruins of a stone barn built in 1852, the ruins of a stone springhouse, and a stone mileage marker identifying the location as being four miles from the City of Wilmington.[2]

It is a middle-class area with many single-family homes that is in proximity to many of Baltimore's urban amenities. The neighborhood began in 1869 when 50 acres (200,000 m2) of land were purchased for development. The land was divided and turned over to various builders who constructed home exteriors, leaving the interiors to be custom built according to buyer specifications. The area was first developed as a streetcar suburb in the early 20th century, and is thought to be the first community to employ tract housing tactics.[5] At the time, the area was known as Peabody Heights; the moniker Charles Village, derived from Charles Street, the area's major north-south corridor, was coined in the 1970s as the beginning of a process of conceptually grouping a large and somewhat heterogeneous area. The neighborhood history has been researched and published by Gregory J. Alexander and Paul K. Williams in their book Charles Village: A Brief History (The History Press, 2009).[6]

The county residents later became staunch supporters of independence and the American Revolution, and Founding Father Patrick Henry was one of its most famous residents.  His grave and the national memorial dedicated to him are located in Charlotte County.
Residents of Charlotte County were heavily involved in the American Revolution.  County delegates supported resolutions against the Stamp Act of 1765,[4] and the county government was the second governing body to declare independence from English rule.[3]  In addition, Charlotte militia units fought under General Robert Lawson during the Yorktown campaign, which effectively led to the end of the American War of Independence.[4]  Finally, the final resting place and national memorial to revolutionary hero Patrick Henry is at Red Hill Plantation.[6]

Up until the building of a bridge over the Rabacca Dry River access to the north side of the river was not possible when rain caused the river to swell and make the path impassable.
