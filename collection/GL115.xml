The wall originally formed a semi-circle extending for some 1,100 metres (3,600 ft), roughly southwards from <link wikipedia="Chepstow_Castle" osm="5230226" type="relation">Chepstow Castle</link> to the <link wikipedia="River_Wye" osm="2877486" type="relation">River Wye</link>.  It enclosed an area of 53 hectares (130 acres), including the entire town and port as it existed at that time.  Substantial sections of the wall remain intact, and both the Port Wall and the Town Gate are Grade I listed buildings.   The Port Wall is a Scheduled monument.

The earliest houses in the district are predominantly Queen Anne style, with late 1800s houses being mostly two stories and early 1900s houses mostly one story.  During the second wave of construction between 1920 and 1938, most houses built were bungalows.  Five apartment buildings were also built to house the influx of workers coming to the area, centered on North Cherry Street and East Tuscaloosa Street, which became known as "Angel Corner" after its developer, J. M. Angel.[2]  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.[1]

A small village, originally supporting logging operations in the area, has existed here since at least the time of Henry David Thoreau, who wrote about it The Maine Woods.  The village is now a primarily seasonal settlement that caters principally to outdoors enthusiasts.  Seven historic properties on or near the "Main Street" fronting the lake were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.[1]

Originally the site of an Abenaki encampment, it arose in the 1840s as a frontier logging village, after damming the river enlarged the lake and made possible logging drives further upstream.  Henry David Thoreau described the village in The Maine Woods after his visit 1853 as having "quite a harbor".  The village's oldest surviving house, the Chesuncook Lake House, was built in 1864 as a boarding house and lodge, and the village grew over the following decades, reaching a population of about 65 in 1900 and about 250 in 1920.  The nature of logging drives in the region was altered by the construction of the <link wikipedia="Ripogenus_Gorge" osm="3800919219" type="node">Ripogenus Dam</link> in 1916, and the village declined in the 20th century.[2] The Chesuncook Lake House burned down on March 17th 2018 at 2:30am.[3]
