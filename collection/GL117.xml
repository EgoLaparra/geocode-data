Early settlers relied heavily upon an agriculturally based economy, with included dairying, poultry and potato crops.

A railroad was constructed in 1872, with a line running through eastern and northern sections of Claridon. This aided in shipping butter, eggs, cheese and maple syrup to the other communities.

During the American Revolutionary War, British forces occupied the meeting house and minister's house for use as a barracks and hospital from 1776 to 1779. After the war, a committee of Second Church members, including William Ellery, Henry Marchant, Robert Stevens and William Channing wrote to <link wikipedia="John_Adams" osm="2507597" type="relation">John Adams</link> in Europe requesting that he contact Reformed congregations there for assistance in repairing the church due to the British army's damage to the building.[2] Adams responded that he would be unable to help because of differences in European attitudes toward soliciting for funds.[3] Regardless of the difficulties, the building was extensively repaired in 1785. The congregation later left the building and merged with Newport's First Congregational Church to become United Congregational Church to which the building was sold in 1835. In 1847 the Central Baptist Society, which broke off from the Second Baptist Church in Newport, purchased and extensively modified the building. The Central Baptist Church later reunited with the Second Baptist Church and then in the 1940s reunited with the First Baptist Church in Newport to form the United Baptist Church. In 1950 St. Joseph's Church of Newport purchased the meeting house and further renovated the structure.[4] The Clarke Street Meeting House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.[1]

The operator in a tower moved the arms to a sequence of positions, spelling out text messages in semaphore code.  The operator in the next tower read the message through a telescope, then passed it on to the next tower.  This was the first practical telecommunications system of the industrial age, and was used until the 1850s when electric telegraph systems replaced it.

He began buying land for his plantation in 1804. The Ashland farm—which during Clay's lifetime was outside of the city limits—at its largest consisted of over 600 acres (240 ha). It is unclear whether Clay named the plantation or retained a prior name, but he was referring to his estate as "Ashland" by 1809. The name derives from the ash forest that stood at the site. Clay and his family resided at Ashland from c. 1806 until his death in 1852 (his widow Lucretia Clay moved out in 1854). Given his political career, Clay spent most of the years between 1810 and 1829 in <link wikipedia="Washington,_D.C." osm="158368533 3663606753 5396194" type="node node relation">Washington, DC</link>.

The jail was built in 1922, three years after Clearmont's incorporation, to address the growing crime problem in the town. During the 1920s, the jail was mainly used to house drunkards and bootleggers. Once Prohibition was repealed, the nature of crime in Clearmont changed, though by the 1950s the majority of criminals were still disruptive drunkards. By this point, the jail no longer had modern eating or restroom facilities; while this was considered a deterrent to crime by some residents, the jail stopped housing criminals after 1961 nonetheless. The jail is now a local tourist attraction.[2]
