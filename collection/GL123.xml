It is situated at the intersection of Avenida Belgrano and Rivadavia. The cathedral is the city's main Roman Catholic church, serving the Diocese of Comodoro Rivadavia, part of the Archdiocese of Bahía Blanca. It was inaugurated by Bishop Moure Argimiro on November 26, 1978, and consecrated on June 9, 1979, by Monsignor Mariano Pérez, first Bishop of Comodoro Rivadavia. The building was constructed in Gothic-Modern style; some elements, such as a stained glass window, were brought from <link wikipedia="Turin" osm="63621589 43992" type="node relation">Turin</link>, Italy, in 1959.[1]

      <p id="GL123_009_002" num_links="2">Until 1941, the only religious establishment in Comodoro Rivadavia was the chapel in the Colegio María Auxiliadora. On the initiative of the military governor, General Armando Raggio, plans were prepared for a larger church. This led to the construction of the San Pedro Crypt, which was first used at Christmas 1949.[2] As a result of the growth of Comodoro Rivadavia into a large city, a bishopric was established on February 11, 1957, by Pope Pius XII, encompassing the whole of <link wikipedia="Chubut_Province" osm="153548" type="relation">Chubut Province</link>. The first bishop of Comodoro Rivadavia was Carlos Mariano Pérez, who took up office on July 6, 1957, remaining until December 26, 1963, when he was transferred to the Archdiocese of Salta.[3] Work on the cathedral began in 1958, above the San Pedro Crypt, and was completed in November 1978.[4] Dedicated to the patron saint of the diocese, <link wikipedia="John_Bosco" osm="1720352723 4511452199 35585004" type="node node way">John Bosco</link> (San Juan Bosco), the cathedral was consecrated on July 9, 1979, by Bishop Argimiro Daniel Moure in the presence of President Rafael Videla.[2][3] The current bishop, Joaquín Gimeno Lahoz, was appointed on July 15, 2010,[5] and was consecrated as a Bishop on October 15, 2010.[6]

The four southernmost communes can also produce wine under the Saint-Joseph AOC. The wines made in this AOC are exclusively white, from the Viognier grape, which may have originated in the region. Within Condrieu is the enclave AOC of Château-Grillet, producing wines that are also 100% Viognier. The Condrieu AOC was officially created in 1940.[2]

Although Code Noir was implemented in 1724, giving enslaved Africans the day off on Sundays, there were no laws in place giving them the right to congregate. Despite constant threat to these congregations, they often gathered in remote and public places such as along levees, in public squares, in backyards, and anywhere they could find. On <link wikipedia="Bayou_St._John" osm="305205" type="relation">Bayou St. John</link> at a clearing called "la place congo" the various ethnic or cultural groups of Colonial Louisiana traded and socialized.[2] It was not until 1817 that the mayor of New Orleans issued a city ordinance that restricted any kind of gathering of enslaved Africans to the one location of Congo Square. They were allowed to gather in the  "Place des Nègres", "Place Publique", later "Circus Square" or informally "Place Congo" [3] at the "back of town" (across <link wikipedia="Rampart_Street" osm="627792952" type="way">Rampart Street</link> from the <link wikipedia="French_Quarter" osm="740658024" type="node">French Quarter</link>), where the enslaved would set up a market, sing, dance, and play music. This singing, dancing and playing started as a byproduct of the original market during the French reign. At the time the enslaved could purchase their freedom and could freely buy and sell goods in the square in order to raise money to escape slavery.[4]
