The village has two ponds; one is next to the church and the other is near the Manor House. The pond near the church used to be used as a splash pond for washing cart wheels. The pond near the Manor House used to supply water for Conington Hall. The pond is notoriously deep, and claimed the lives of two young boys in the Victorian era, when they attempted to learn to swim across it using a rope. The rope snapped, and the boys drowned. Today the pond is known by locals as big tree corner.

The castle was initially built in the 11th century by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Hamelin Plantagenet, the illegitimate, parvenu son of Henry II, acquired the property by marriage in the late 12th century. Hamelin and his son William rebuilt the castle in stone, including its prominent 28-metre (92 ft)-high keep. The castle remained in the family line into the 14th century, despite being seized several times by the Crown. The fortification was then given to Edmund of Langley, passing back into royal ownership in 1461.

It was also created to be a kind of human habitat and includes artwork such as murals and green spaces such as the Santiago Tlatelolco Garden. Today, the complex is smaller than it was and in a state of deterioration, mostly due the effects and after effects of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. This quake caused the immediate collapse of the Nuevo León building with others being demolished in the months afterwards. Further earthquakes in 1993 caused the condemnation of more buildings. In addition to the lost buildings, many residents eventually undersold or abandoned their apartments, as repairs were either never made or made poorly.

In its present location, it occupies an area of 28 hectares (69 acres) adjacent to <link wikipedia="Lake_Geneva" osm="332617" type="relation">Lake Geneva</link> and the park of the United Nations Office at Geneva and ranks as one of the five most important in the world. The gardens themselves were designed by Jules Allemand [fr]. The Botanical Garden's greenhouses initially remained at the Bastions site for financial reasons. Then, in 1910–1911, the architect Henri Juvet built a Winter Garden along the former Chemin de Varembe, which was moved to its present location close to the railway lines following the construction of the <link wikipedia="Palace_of_Nations" osm="26176780 583876551" type="way way">Palais des Nations</link> and the various associated urban redevelopments that took place. The elegant glass and iron structure is in line with constructions of this type in fashion in the second half of the 19th century. It originally comprised two adjacent but separate sections: the Winter Garden and a greenhouse, creating an asymmetrical effect. A symmetrical wing was added to the first in 1935. The greenhouses at Bastions were removed to make way for the <link wikipedia="Reformation_Wall" osm="36174871" type="node">Wall of the Reformers</link>.

      <p id="GL124_213_001" num_links="5">The Consulate General of France in Jerusalem (French: Consulat Général de France à Jérusalem) began its tumultuous history in the early 17th century. In 1535, the date of the first Capitulation between France and the Ottoman Empire, France was granted the right to appoint consuls in the cities of the Empire.[1] The Capitulations constituted the legal basis of the French protectorate over the Holy Places, <link wikipedia="Catholic_Church" osm="618656792" type="way">Catholic</link> Christians, and by extension, Orthodox Christians. In 1623, King Louis XIII appointed the first consul in <link wikipedia="Jerusalem" osm="29090735 1381350 6502363" type="node relation relation">Jerusalem</link> "for the Glory of God and to relieve the pious pilgrims whom by devotion visit the Holy Places."[2] The presence of consuls in Jerusalem was intermittent until 1843. Amidst the growing competition between European powers over the exclusive protectorate that France was entitled to exercise over Christians, the rank of the Consul in Jerusalem was raised to that of a Consul General in 1893.[3]
Despite the abolition of France's protectorate over the Latins and the Turkish-ruled Holy Places in 1914, the Consulate General tried to maintain and expand its influence in Palestine.[4] Since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, the Consulate General of France in Jerusalem has held the status of a quasi-embassy. The Consulate is responsible for the area of the corpus separatum and the occupied territories. The Consulate’s districts include Jerusalem, the <link wikipedia="Gaza_Strip" osm="581141063 1473938" type="node relation">Gaza Strip</link> and the <link wikipedia="West_Bank" osm="1472876649 1613659" type="node relation">West Bank</link>. The Consulate General is independent from the Embassy of France in <link wikipedia="Tel_Aviv" osm="278472603 1382494" type="node relation">Tel Aviv</link> and does not have official diplomatic relations with Israel.[5] All contacts with the State of Israel lie exclusively within the jurisdiction of the embassy in Tel Aviv. Since its establishment in 1994, the Consulate has been the French diplomatic representative to the Palestinian National Authority.[6]

During the period of time leading up to World War I, the Consulate played a mostly commercial and representational role in Thessaloniki due to the lack of visa requirements for U.S. travel and due to the small number of Americans both living in and passing through the city.  Dr. Henry House was one of the few prominent Americans living in Thessaloniki during this period.  Dr. House established the American Farm School, which is still in operation today.

      <p id="GL124_235_002" num_links="2">The Contemporary Arts Center was founded as the Modern Art Society in 1939 by Betty Pollak Rauh, Peggy Frank Crawford and Rita Rentschler Cushman.  These three women were able to raise enough money through donations to display modern art at the <link wikipedia="Cincinnati_Art_Museum" osm="1338829" type="relation">Cincinnati Art Museum</link>.  Early advice and encouragement was offered by both Edward M.M. Warburg, a friend of the Pollak family, as well as Alfred H. Barr.  The society's very first exhibit, Modern Painting from Cincinnati Collections, opened in December of the same year.  In 1954 the Modern Art Society adopted its current name, the Contemporary Arts Center.  The name change coincided with the creation of two permanent galleries that were remodeled from part of the museum's lower level. These two spaces, designed by Carl Strauss and Ray Roush, consisted of about 900 square feet each and featured movable wooden wall covers.  Many local Cincinnati collections were shown in this space, including works now kept at the <link wikipedia="Cincinnati_Art_Museum" osm="1338829" type="relation">Cincinnati Art Museum</link> from the Mary E.

The darkest period in the monastery of San Marcos's five centuries of history is concentrated in just four years. During the course of the Spanish Civil War cells, rooms, stables, cloisters, church, choir, museum and every fast corner of the building were transformed into impromptu dungeons or jailers' offices.
Between July 1936 and the end of 1940, up to 7,000 men and 300 women were imprisoned at the same time. It is estimated that, over the entire war and the period immediately following, the number of Republican militia members and political prisoners that passed through its cells totaled some 20,000. In the province of Leon, around 3,000 deaths are recorded due to the repression, and a good number of these came from the dungeons of San Marcos.

Although not much of the community remains, the U.S. Geological Survey considers it a populated place.  The community existed as a "flag" station along a railroad, and is named after railroad executive Joel N.

</p>
      <p id="GL124_316_002" num_links="2">In 1837, Edward Crumley moved to the southeast corner of the Blackford County, and began a farm with his family.  The area in this corner of the county would eventually be named Jackson Township.  Crumley's farm was located at a crossroads, and the area became known as Crumley's Crossing.  The crossroads area grew into a small community with several cabins, a blacksmith shop, and a sawmill.[3]   The Union and Logansport Railroad Company reached Blackford County in 1867, and the community became a flag stop on the railroad.[4]  The community was platted in 1867, and renamed for railroad executive Joel N. Converse.[3]  In addition to a sawmill and blacksmith shop, the community had a store, school, and church. The church was a Methodist church, but later became the Kingsley Full Gospel church.  For this reason, the area is sometimes called by a third name, which is "Kingsley".  Thus, Crumley's Crossing, Converse, and Kingsley all refer to the same place in Blackford County.[3]  Blackford County's Converse should not be confused with the town of <link wikipedia="Converse,_Indiana" osm="127572" type="relation">Converse</link>, which is located in <link wikipedia="Grant_County,_Indiana" osm="1802226" type="relation">Grant County</link>.

These developments have resulted in large scale tree-felling. However, Cooke Town still manages to retain some of its colonial charm, and is called the nicest place in the Cantonment by Bangalore historian Peter Colaco.[1] Cooke Town is a posh neighbourhood with plenty of greenery, parks, educational institutions, hospitals and is at close proximity to the Bangalore East Railway Station and the Bangalore CBD. According to Colliers International, Cooke Town is one of Bangalore's most costliest neighbourhoods, with the cost of property being in the range to INR 60000-65000 per sq.ft (in January 2020), just slightly lesser than the Bangalore CBD.[2][3][4][5]

The explanation of the choice to use bronze can be attriubuted to the type of warfare that the helmet was used for; also the cultural affinities have influence on why the helmet was made the way that it was.[1] Within a long process of evolution, Roman military armor for the head developed from early pre-Roman helmets. Rome itself had no proper tradition of such objects, as most of the soldiers of the Early Republic made use of helmets produced by the Etruscans, whose craftsmen were known for their ability to make vessels.[2] The Canterbury helmet from England is an example.

The raised second floor includes three zones: The public area (living room and dining room), the bedroom wing (with its pendant guest wing) and finally the kitchen and servants areas.  The original residence was over-9000-square-feet and built on a ten-acre parcel.  The entrance halls, playroom and sewing room are on the ground floor. An entire complex of interrelated buildings with extensive raised and sunken gardens was designed by landscape architect Jens Jensen. The main structure of the Avery Coonley Estate is the public-living room wing, located on Bloomingbank Road and behind that facing Scottswood Road is the bedroom wing of the mansion. The complex also includes a separate stable-coach house and gardener's cottage (1911). Along with the <link wikipedia="Robie_House" osm="125667497" type="way">Robie House</link>, the Coonley Estate represents the maturation of Wright's Prairie Style, typified by wide overhanging eaves, bands of art glass casement windows, free-flowing interior spaces and the harmonious blending of site and structure.
