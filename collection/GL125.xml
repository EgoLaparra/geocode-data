In the early years the zoo focused on showing as many different types of animals as possible, but as animal welfare later became an issue, the number of different species has dropped in favour of more space to each animal. In 1901 the zoo had a human display with 25 <link wikipedia="India" osm="424314145 304716" type="node relation">Indians</link>- men, women and children- in an exhibition where the "brown exotic" people went about their daily lives in palm tree leaf huts constructed in the middle of the zoo.[5]
One of the most notable animals kept there was a male slow worm that lived there from 1892 to 1946 (for 54 years, which is a record among lizards).[6][7]

Residents, Bob “Shack” Shackelford, Fielding “Dutch” Schulz, and Paul Vickery were first to recognize this threat to their simple rural living. These men convinced Bill Ferris, Bob Woodin, Tom Murray and Bob Allen to incorporate the town in an effort to preserve the rural atmosphere and freedom of the community.

The brick Greek Revival building was constructed in 1864 to house the Union Guard of Copperopolis, the town's regiment of the Union Army. Copperopolis largely owed its existence to the war; the town grew due to a boom in local copper mining in 1860, which stemmed from the Union Army's need for copper ammunition. The armory served a variety of purposes for the Union Guard; at the building, new soldiers were enlisted, training was conducted, and arms and supplies were stored. Military balls, victory celebrations, and the local funeral ceremonies for <link wikipedia="Abraham_Lincoln" osm="95139887" type="way">Abraham Lincoln</link> also took place in the armory. The armory also held an 1837 bronze cannon, which was used for ceremonial purposes and arms training; the cannon remains in the building and is one of the few American bronze cannons from the era in California. After the war, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows bought the building, which they converted to a social hall. In 1940, the armory became a community center.[2]

However, there is no evidence that Montour ever lived on this tract.  The first permanent white settler in Coraopolis was Capt. Robert Vance, who settled in the vicinity of Montour's tract around 1773, just prior to the beginning of the American Revolution.  Vance, a Virginian, had been a member of the regiment commanded by George Washington at the Braddock expedition during the French and Indian War.  For the protection of himself and his neighbors, of whom several arrived within a few years, Vance had a log stockade built with a stone blockhouse to protect the area against Indian raids.  This was known as Vance Fort (or Fort Vance).  The site of the fort was around present-day Broadway and Chestnut streets, near Second Avenue.  Over time the community grew and developed, and it became known as Middletown in the 1800s, either because it was situated midway between <link wikipedia="Pittsburgh" osm="34184938 188553" type="node relation">Pittsburgh</link> and <link wikipedia="Beaver,_Pennsylvania" osm="154123224 187291" type="node relation">Beaver, Pennsylvania</link>, or perhaps after an early settler named Alexander Middleton who supposedly ran "Middleton's Tavern" in the area.[5]

There can be no doubt that Corfinium was from an early period the capital city of the Paeligni, and one of the chief towns in this part of Italy; but no mention of its name is found in history until the outbreak of the Social War, in 90 BCE, when it was selected by the confederates to be their common capital, and the seat of their government. It was probably to the importance of its situation in a military point of view that it was mainly indebted for this distinction; but the allied nations seem to have destined it to be the permanent capital of Italy, and the rival of Rome, as they changed its name to Italica, and adorned it with a new and spacious forum and senate house, and other public buildings of a style corresponding to its intended greatness.[1] But before the end of the second year of the war they were compelled to abandon their new capital, and transfer the seat of government to Aesernia (modern <link wikipedia="Isernia" osm="67283753 41385" type="node relation">Isernia</link>).[2] The fate of Corfinium after this is not mentioned, but it probably fell into the hands of the Romans without resistance, and in consequence did not suffer; for we find it at the outbreak of the Civil War between Julius Caesar and Pompey, 49 BCE, still retaining its position as a city of importance and a strong fortress. On this account it was occupied by L. Domitius with 31 cohorts[3], and was the only place which offered any effectual resistance to the arms of Caesar during his advance through Italy. Nor was it reduced by force, but the disaffection which rapidly spread among his officers compelled Domitius to surrender after a siege of only seven days.[4] Along with the garrison, several important Republican personages were also captured; Caesar released these after obtaining their oaths of loyalty, oaths many promptly broke.[5]

The canal was dug through the Isthmus at sea level and has no locks. It is 6.4 kilometres (4 mi) in length and only 21.4 metres (70 ft) wide at its base, making it impassable for most modern ships. Nowadays it has little economic importance and is mainly a tourist attraction.
The canal was initially proposed in classical times and a failed effort was made to build it in the 1st century AD.[2] Construction started in 1881 but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders. It was completed in 1893 but, due to the canal's narrowness, navigational problems and periodic closures to repair landslides from its steep walls, it failed to attract the level of traffic expected by its operators.

Here converged three major Abenaki Indian paths—the Sokokis Trail (Route 5), the Ossipee Trail (Route 25) and the Pequawket Trail (Route 113), making it a central location for conducting with Native Americans the lucrative fur trade. In 1668, Small purchased from Newichawannock Chief Captain Sunday (or Wesumbe) the Ossipee Tract, encompassing the present-day towns of Cornish, <link wikipedia="Parsonsfield,_Maine" osm="158817707 2021332" type="node relation">Parsonsfield</link>, <link wikipedia="Newfield,_Maine" osm="158816037 2021331" type="node relation">Newfield</link>, <link wikipedia="Limerick,_Maine" osm="2021418" type="relation">Limerick</link>, <link wikipedia="Limington,_Maine" osm="2021655" type="relation">Limington</link> and <link wikipedia="Shapleigh,_Maine" osm="2021333" type="relation">Shapleigh</link> (which then included <link wikipedia="Acton,_Maine" osm="158802683 2021330" type="node relation">Acton</link>).
