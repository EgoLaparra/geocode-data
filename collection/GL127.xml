      <p id="GL127_017_002" num_links="3">Cotter was established in 1905 as a railroad town.

The federal road would bring an economic boom to the tourist-themed Ozarks that had not been developed, but the funding was still not available due to Arkansas' lack of a central road authority.[3] The state approved the use of toll bridges in 1927, as long as they became free upon payment of the debt.[4] Judge R.M. Ruthven concealed a damning feasibility report from the Highway Commission, which would've resulted in the bridge being built elsewhere.[5] Twenty years later, he allegedly mailed the report to the Commission anyway.[5] President Calvin Coolidge signed the bridge into construction on May 2, 1928, and upon approval by the War Department, the bridge was contracted to James Barney Marsh.[6]

They are sometimes also found in non-residential settings such as hotels, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, and bars.

The word couch originated in Middle English from the Old French noun couche, which derived from the verb meaning "to lie down".[5] It originally denoted an item of furniture for lying or sleeping on,[6][7] somewhat like a chaise longue, but now refers to sofas in general.[citation needed] The word sofa comes from Turkish and is derived from the <link wikipedia="Arabic" osm="6271347691" type="node">Arabic</link> word suffah ("ledge/bench"), cognates with the Aramaic word sippa ("mat").[8] Joseph Pubillones in A Little Shimmer Goes a Long Way specifies that the main difference between the couch and the sofa is that "couches can be used for reclining or laying upon" so a couch would "best be used to describe an upholstered piece in a family room", while the term sofa "used predominantly in England and Ireland denotes a tone of formality, hence a sofa is more appropriate word for the upholstered piece in the living room".[9]

Its historically irregular course, alternating between two beds on the north and south of the Mont Saint-Michel but eventually definitely settling to the south bed, inspired the saying "The Couesnon in its madness placed the Mont in Normandy" ("le Couesnon en sa folie mit le Mont en Normandie"), as the Mont is just to the Norman side of the river's current mouth. However, the administrative boundary separating the two regions does not depend on the course of the river, and is about six kilometers west of the Mont.

Its soil dates from the Tertiary. Under a layer of silt, one finds argillaceous chalk and flints. The plateau slopes gently to the north-east from 160 meters at a place called Le Crocq down to 120 meters in the Coullemelle and Grivesnes valleys. Located 80 kilometers from the sea, the village benefits from a temperate and healthy climate. At the North exit of the Coullemelle wood lies a larris, that is a zone of lawn and poor lands, most interesting for geologists and botanists. The dry valleys of Simie, Langueron, mont Foucart and Coullemelle, oriented N.E.-S.W., ties cuts through the chalky plateau that descends into the dry ravine occupied by trees but also by calcicole lawns.[2] One may find there lady orchids, fragrant orchids, red epacris, superb violet anemone that are exceptional in France, as well as very rare cruciate anemones.[3] The larris, unsuited to culture and which served as a pasture for sheep, are unfortunately more and more overgrown with underbrush.

The private lake is in the center of the Countryside neighborhood and is designated for use by the CLA (Countryside Lake Association) and their guests. Countryside Lake was created in 1926 by putting a dam at the end of a boggy stream.  After the dam was created dredging equipment was brought to clear the surrounding area to expand the stream into a lake. Since Countryside Lake is manmade it is very shallow, at a maximum depth of 10 feet (3.0 m) the lake is mostly recreational.[2] The lake is around 120 acres (49 ha) so it is on the smaller side for a lake. Since the lake is so small, only boats with 15 horsepower or less are allowed on the lake, this is intended to keep the shoreline from deteriorating. Countryside Lake has one beach that has a lifeguard for most days of the summer months.[3] At the beach there is a playground, horseshoes, and numerous docks for boats.

It was updated in 1918 with Chicago Commercial style design elements when modified for use as a Moose Lodge (1918-1946).  The Courier newspaper occupied the building from 1856 to 1905. It was the site of Daniel Webster's 1851 "Syracuse Speech" in which he equated resistance to the Fugitive Slave Law with treason. In response, crowds in the area freed an escaped slave from the custody of federal marshals, galvanizing opposition to slavery in Central New York.[2]:5, 11–12

The Confederate Lords, opponents of Mary, Queen of Scots, gathered at Cousland in 1567 at the time of the stand-off at Carberry Hill.[4] After the execution of William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, in 1584 for his part in the events of Carberry Hill, Cousland passed successively to the Herries, the Hays of Kinfauns, and the <link wikipedia="Oxenfoord_Castle" osm="244349050" type="way">Macgills of Oxenfuird</link>, before coming to the Dalrymples, later Earls of Stair, in the 1690s.[1] Cousland Smiddy is a blacksmith's workshop built in the 18th century, which unusually remains in working order, and is a category B listed building.[5]
