The estate was technologically advanced; the architect of the house, Richard Norman Shaw, wrote that it was equipped with "wonderful hydraulic machines that do all sorts of things".[2] In the grounds, Armstrong built dams and lakes to power a sawmill, a water-powered laundry, early versions of a dishwasher and a dumb waiter, a hydraulic lift and a hydroelectric rotisserie.

The Preston family of Craigmillar, the local feudal barons, began building the castle in the late 14th century and building works continued through the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1660 the castle was sold to Sir John Gilmour, Lord President of the Court of Session, who made further alterations. The Gilmours left Craigmillar in the 18th century, and the castle fell into ruin. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.[1]

The earthwork is also unusual in that the area it encloses slopes from 120 metres (390 ft) to 170 metres (560 ft) above sea level.

      <p id="GL128_482_001" num_links="2">The Crater Glacier[1] (also known as Tulutson Glacier) is a geologically young glacier that is located on <link wikipedia="Mount_St._Helens" osm="356546327" type="node">Mount St. Helens</link>, in the U.S. state of <link wikipedia="Washington_(state)" osm="34724864 165479" type="node relation">Washington</link>. The glacier formed after the 1980 Eruption and due to its location, the body of ice grew rapidly, unknown to the public for nearly 20 years. The glacier once contained ice caves in the smooth ice before the 2004-2008 volcanic activity. The growth of the lava dome and volcanic eruptions from 2004 to 2008 significantly altered the appearance of the glacier.[2] In the same time period, several agencies decided to put an official name on the glacier which, at first, was Tulutson Glacier. A later decision made Crater Glacier the official glacier name. Despite the volcanic activity, the glacier continued to advance and by mid-2008, the glacier completely encircled the lava domes.[2][3][4][5] In addition, new glaciers (rock or ice) have formed around Crater Glacier as well.[6]

</p>
      <p id="GL128_482_002" num_links="4">True to its name, the glacier lies inside the north-facing crater left by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens and the glacier's elevation is about 6,794 ft (2,071 m).[7] A massive central lava dome emplaced from 1980 to 1987 occupies the center of the crater, and the glacier formed in the shape of a <link wikipedia="Horseshoe" osm="6357070804" type="node">horseshoe</link> around the dome, with two terminal moraines on the eastern and western sides.  Heavy winter snowfall, repeated snow avalanches, rockfalls, and sun-shading by the surrounding cliffs to the south, led to the exceptionally rapid growth of this glacier.[8] Thus, the glacier composition is estimated to be 60% ice and 40%rock,[9] with an average thickness of 328 feet (100 m)[10] and a maximum thickness of around 656 feet (200 m); nearly as deep as <link wikipedia="Mount_Rainier" osm="1744903493" type="node">Mount Rainier</link>'s <link wikipedia="Carbon_Glacier" osm="5544150" type="relation">Carbon Glacier</link>.[2] None of the ice is older than the year 1980, but by 2001 the volume of the new glacier was about 40%-50% as large as all the pre–1980 glaciers combined.[11]  The surface of the glacier looks dark and dirty in the summer due to the numerous rockfalls from the steep, unstable crater walls along with ash from eruptions, all of which help to insulate and protect the growing glacier.[12][13][14][15][16] The 2004-2008 volcanic activity created a series of domes that nearly split the glacier into two lobes at the south end of the crater.[12] In spite of the four-year lava dome building period, the glacier remains <link wikipedia="North_America" osm="36966063" type="node">North America</link>'s youngest and fastest growing glacier.[17] With the joining of the termini on the north end of Crater Glacier in May 2008, the body of ice completely encircles the lava domes.[4][5] Meltwater from the glacier gives rise to Loowit Creek.[18]
