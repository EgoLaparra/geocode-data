      <p id="GL128_162_002" num_links="6">The land on which Clifton Park sits was once farmland. Built around 1803, the home was originally the summer residence of Capt. Henry Thompson, (1774-1837). Born in <link wikipedia="Sheffield" osm="25599476" type="way">Sheffield, England</link>, he came to <link wikipedia="Baltimore" osm="671113 154196553 133345" type="node node relation">Baltimore</link> around 1794, and soon became a prominent figure in the newly-emerging city as a merchant, financier, and company director. Thompson was public-spirited and used his knowledge of horses in military matters to serve as a cavalry officer in the Maryland State Militia's "Baltimore Light Dragoons", which he joined in 1809 and was elected captain. He later organized the "First Baltimore Horse Artillery" in 1813, which defended Baltimore during the British attack during the War of 1812 at the Battle of Baltimore, the <link wikipedia="Fort_McHenry" osm="49666619 1116862" type="way relation">bombardment of Fort McHenry</link> which inspired the writing of the Star Spangled Banner. the Battle of North Point, and the stand-off at what is now known as <link wikipedia="Patterson_Park" osm="49664223" type="way">Patterson Park</link> in East Baltimore, on September 12-13-14, 1814. Prior to seeing action in Baltimore, he was assigned by Brig. Gen. John Stricker, commander of the Third Brigade (also known as the Baltimore City Brigade) of the Maryland State Militia, to carry messages between Bladensburg, Maryland, and the nearby national capital in Washington, D.C., during the first phase of the <link wikipedia="Battle_of_Bladensburg" osm="2277323159" type="node">Battle of Bladensburg</link>, which preceded the Burning of Washington during the <link wikipedia="Chesapeake_Bay" osm="369003154" type="node">Chesapeake Bay</link> campaign in August 1814. Later he and his mounted unit served as the personal bodyguard of Maj. Gen. Samuel Smith, overall commander of the State Militia under then-Maryland governor Levin Winder, and the various militia forces from surrounding counties and states, including several regular army and navy units and detachments defending Baltimore in September 1814.

The Donlins who ran the club during the 1970s pronounced the name PASSim, and Bob Donlin said this as he welcomed people to the shows with the always-out-of-adjustment mic stand microphone, but those who didn't know that always said PassEEM, perhaps thinking they were correct. It adopted the present name in 1994; a combination of the earlier two names. At its inception, it was mainly a jazz and blues club, but soon branched out to include ethnic folk, then singer-songwriter folk.[2]
