Capacity is held in the reservoir throughout the winter so that it retains capacity to mitigate downstream flooding by absorbing excess flow from the head-waters of the Afon Clywedog, a tributary of the <link wikipedia="River_Severn" osm="14304" type="relation">River Severn</link> . The reservoir was formed by damming both the Afon Clywedog and a much smaller embankment dam located at Bwlch-y-gle to prevent overflow into the next valley. Its concrete buttress dam is the tallest concrete dam in the UK, with a height of 72 metres and a length of 230 metres. When at capacity the reservoir contains approximately 50,000 megalitres of water. .

      <p id="GL129_064_002" num_links="3">In 1885, a group of settlers established a town in Carbon County, Utah, and called it Oak Springs Bench. Because the town's elevation was approximately 7,000 feet (2,100 m), farming and ranching were difficult.[2] However, soon after the town was settled, coal was discovered in the area. Small-scale mining took place under the Great Western Coal Mines Company, but mining operations weren't large due to the town's distance from the nearest railroad. In August 1921, the permanent town site was platted and renamed Coal City, after the deposits of coal in the area. The town was incorporated in October 1921.[3] Although most of the houses were tents, a log school house served Coal City in 1925, and was replaced by a brick schoolhouse in 1927. Later that year, a couple <link wikipedia="Retail" osm="3551232258 3551232265 23548665 26505424 44652556 252962099 252962105 304849858 361072681 369995223 422066664 677295424 677295685 677295721 679613646 679789006 679874730 679875622 679887959 680044384 680923611 681279520 698105382 698105383 698114427 698116887 698120279 698202487" type="node node way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way">stores</link> and a <link wikipedia="Bakery" osm="619053278" type="way">bakery</link> were constructed, and made up the business district.

At its peak, the population was about 70. In 1926, the mine superintendent, George Storrs, was indicted for mail fraud. Though he was cleared of charges, in December 1926, Storrs's mining company went bankrupt and halted operations.[3] The town began to decline in 1935 and by 1940 it was uninhabited. A few buildings remain in Coal City, including two stores, several houses, and a few outbuildings.[4]

The land is on or near some of the most important legends, historical events, and culturally significant spots to Native Hawaiians. The land where the Coco Palms Resort sits is ancient Hawaiian royal property that has been in dispute since 1866, beginning with the petition of Junius Kaae, along with Kapiolani, Kalakaua, and others. Their petition, attempting to revoke the will of Kealiiahonui, filed in probate by Levi Haʻalelea in 1855, was eventually overturned by Sanford B. Dole almost immediately after the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Dole was acting as a justice of the supreme court of the provincial government after stepping down from the bench and then being seated as president. Litigants were made to sign an agreement for this adjudication to be allowed by Dole.

The donation was made with several stipulations including that (1) a street, known as Elm Street, near the rear of the property be removed and abandoned, (2) the Coe’s home and outbuildings be removed; (3) Mrs. Coe’s large, Victorian greenhouse be removed, and (4) a monument be erected acknowledging the gift and its benefactors.

When John died in 1786, the estate was inherited by Llewelyn Traherne,  the son of his sister (who had married Edmund Traherne), and Coedarhydyglyn became the principal seat of the Traherne family. The old house was demolished in 1823, although parts remain. The replacement building was said to be "in the style of Edward Haycock Snr, of <link wikipedia="Shrewsbury" osm="26202801" type="node">Shrewsbury</link>, who designed <link wikipedia="Clytha_Park" osm="508460166" type="way">Clytha House</link>, <link wikipedia="Monmouthshire" osm="358021" type="relation">Monmouthshire</link>".[3] Its owner, Reverend John Montgomery Traherne,[4] during the 19th century, was a notable scholar and collector of scientific manuscripts.[5] During the 1880s, Coedarhydyglyn was reportedly a breeding centre for the golden oriole.[6] Sir Cennydd Traherne, born here on 14 December 1910, was a notable owner in the 20th century;[7] he was Lord Lieutenant of Glamorgan from 1952 to 1974.

The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

It measures approximately 66 feet by 183 feet and includes over 50 carved headstones and 12 uncut stone markers. Located at the cemetery is a small cinder block building, which contains an altar, and stands at the site of the original log mission church built about 1790. It was the first Catholic church in Delaware out of which grew the present Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington.[2] The house was demolished in March 2010 following an arson. The barn, also affected by arson, remained mostly intact but in a decaying condition.[3] Trinity Community Church planned to restore it and incorporate it into a new church on the site, but discovered that the mortar was no longer sound. The barn was demolished in 2016 and the stone saved for reuse in the facade of the new church.[4]

Probably named after the nearby stream which, after rains, froths turbulently and resembles milk. The name is also said to be derived from cofa, ‘press’, mvaba, ‘milk-bag’ (of goat-skin), done to break lumps of sour milk. Another explanation is that the sound of the water gurgling over the rocks is reminiscent of the splashing of milk in the bag when shaken.[3]
