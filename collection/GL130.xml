      <p id="GL130_006_002" num_links="3">In 1963, after the Crawford Corporation accumulated over 1,600 acres (650 ha) of land, it announced that it would build a new community called Crofton. This new town and planned community was founded at the same time as <link wikipedia="Reston,_Virginia" osm="2240795956 206748" type="node relation">Reston, Virginia</link> (April 17, 1964) and <link wikipedia="Columbia,_Maryland" osm="158223559 133606" type="node relation">Columbia, Maryland</link> (1967). Crofton would be anchored by a community golf course, which later became the Crofton Country Club. Crofton was officially founded in the fall of 1964. The company considered picking an English name for the new town that "sounds well and implies that this is a pleasant place to live." It ended up picking the name "Crofton", named after a small township in Cumberland County, England. The <link wikipedia="Crofton,_Cumbria" osm="4405049043 5919960378" type="node node">English town</link> was originally called Croft-town, derived from the word "Croft", as the town standing upon the Crofts. Originally an exclusive gated community, Crofton's gates were opened and they now only serve as a symbol for the community.

It comprises a tall, circular gun tower and an adjacent gun platform, and was designed to prevent enemy naval vessels from entering the harbour. The castle was built in two phases; Sir Robert Blake constructed the tower between 1651 and 1652 in the aftermath of the Parliamentary invasion of the islands at the end of the English Civil War, and Master Gunner Abraham Tovey added the gun platform during the War of Jenkins' Ear around 1739. The tower fell into disuse soon afterwards, and in the 21st century is managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.

The site was redeveloped with 52 apartments and the complex was named "The Old Baths". Other nearby public amenities include a youth centre and an adult education centre. Also in the area are Crook Log Primary School and The Crook Log guest house. An amateur theatre called the Edward Alderton Theatre is in Crook Log. Actor Roger Moore and world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis are former residents of this area.[2]

As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.[4] During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.[4] Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Skagit River.

Crooswijk also has an industrial past. Jamin [nl], Heineken Brewery and many abattoirs were established there. These industries have given way to housing. On the Crooswijksesingel is only the monumental building of Heineken still standing. Crooswijk is one of the original people's neighborhoods of Rotterdam (unlike many other people's neighborhoods in the city, which originally were independent villages) and the district is strongly associated with the 'real' Rotterdammer. The Crooswijk is sometimes called: "The poorest part of the Netherlands", or: "The poorest part of Rotterdam". This is because the average income of the people living there is lower than other places.

It was also known as Croppers Depot. Their post office [2] is closed. The town of Cropper (Population Cal. at 205 in 2010) is located in northeast Shelby County, Kentucky. The origin of its name comes from the town's founder James Cropper, a blacksmith and store keeper who was the first person to build a house there sometime in the 1790s. He also was the town's first postmaster. The majority of Cropper's original citizens were members of the Low Dutch colony who were in the area as early as 1786. In 1807, a new group of settlers from Virginia increased the town's population. In 1855, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L and N) along with a depot opened on the east end of town. A hotel soon opened afterwards. This railroad line was closed in the early 1970s. Another occurrence, in 1855, was the founding of Union Grove Church. This church had three different denominations that included Christian, Methodist and Baptist. The only cemetery in Cropper is on the church grounds. In June 1900, the Baptist separated from the Union Church, and by 1903 it had its own building. In 1967, the Union Grove Church was renamed Cropper Christian Church. In 1905, a bank was opened by Ben Allen Thomas, but it was closed in 1921. An 1882 map shows the first school in Cropper which was a large two-story building with grades one through twelve. It burned in 1951 and was replaced with a one-story elementary school. The team mascot was the Yellow Jackets.

He came to <link wikipedia="Illinois" osm="553784069 122586" type="node relation">Illinois</link> in 1855, settling first at <link wikipedia="Morton,_Illinois" osm="153778873 124791" type="node relation">Morton</link> in <link wikipedia="Tazewell_County,_Illinois" osm="1800585" type="relation">Tazewell County</link>. In 1867 he purchased land in Belle Prairie Township, <link wikipedia="Livingston_County,_Illinois" osm="1800376" type="relation">Livingston County</link>, just north of Cropsey. In 1882 he began buying tile to drain his farmland and then decided to manufacture his own tile in Cropsey. In 1883 he built a large house on the west side of the town of Cropsey.[3] Terpening, whose name was sometimes spelled, Henry L. Terpenning, was a native of <link wikipedia="New_York_(state)" osm="316976734 61320" type="node relation">New York</link> who had been a farmer in Cropsey Township. He was a justice of the peace and represented McLean County in the Illinois State Legislature in the 36th and 37th general assemblies during the early 1890s. About 1892 he moved to <link wikipedia="Vermilion_County,_Illinois" osm="1801537" type="relation">Vermilion County</link>. Before the town of Cropsey was established, there had been several efforts to attract a railroad to Cropsey Township. In October 1869 the township had voted $60,000 in bonds, with an additional $15,000 to be added if a station was established in the township. The money was to have helped finance the Decatur and East St. Louis Railroad. This effort failed. This railroad passed north of the township. A second chance came in 1880 with the Clinton, Bloomington and Northeastern Railroad. A number of local people donated money and land to attract the railroad to Cropsey Township. The town of Cropsey was laid out at the same time as other new towns on this railroad including <link wikipedia="Anchor,_Illinois" osm="153654981 126800" type="node relation">Anchor</link>, <link wikipedia="Colfax,_Illinois" osm="153452889 126791" type="node relation">Colfax</link>, and <link wikipedia="Cooksville,_Illinois" osm="153517980 126790" type="node relation">Cooksville</link>.

</p>
      <p id="GL130_262_002" num_links="2">The island of Manhattan, surrounded by brackish rivers, had a limited supply of fresh water available, which dwindled as the city grew rapidly after the American Revolutionary War, and fresh water sources became polluted by effluent. Before the aqueduct was constructed, residents of New York obtained water from cisterns, wells, natural springs, and other bodies of water. But rapid population growth in the 19th century, and encroachment on these areas as Manhattan moved further north of <link wikipedia="Wall_Street" osm="5672361 112588882 447018423 524610938" type="way way way way">Wall Street</link>, led to the pollution of many local fresh water sources.

      <p id="GL130_450_002" num_links="2">The need for a large stadium in Memphis was first proposed by Clarence Saunders, founder of Piggly Wiggly and owner of the Clarence Saunders Tigers, a semi-professional football team.  After success against other established teams, it was thought that Memphis would join the fledgling National Football League, but the Great Depression wiped out Saunders, and Memphis missed out on professional football for the first time.  In early 1932, plans for a large concrete stadium with a capacity of 25,000 persons was presented to the Mid-South Fair Association with the promise that if it were built, efforts would be made to land "big-time events of the <link wikipedia="Tennis" osm="638584655" type="way">tennis</link> world". On July 17, 1932, the Memphis Park Commission gave tentative approval for a 25,000-seat stadium to be created at the Fairgrounds.  Funds for the stadium were to be raised from the public through a "Buy a Barrel of Cement" project.  However, that project was shelved in favor of a new field at <link wikipedia="Central_High_School_(Memphis,_Tennessee)" osm="496328334" type="way">Central High School</link>.  On August 20, 1932, plans for a new stadium for the City of Memphis were drawn up and approved by the city managers. Funding for this Depression-era project was achieved when, on December 16, 1933, a 3-acre (12,000 m2) athletic field was approved by state and federal Civil Works Authority and construction was completed in 1934. The stadium's original configuration was 7,000 seat capacity on wood bleachers 15 rows high with space for another 4,000 on temporary seating. The stadium was under the control of the City Board of Education, but was available to all levels of teams, from high school to professional

The neighbourhood is triangular in shape, and its boundaries can broadly be described as Carling Avenue to the northeast, Moodie Drive to the west, and Corkstown Road to the south. Crystal Beach was established in the 1960s. Primarily developed by Minto Developments Inc., many of the residences in Crystal Beach are modified versions of the five original models of homes originally built in the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood was later extended in 1974 around Carling via Corkstown Road with townhomes and in 1988 with Maki Park. Some newer portions of the neighbourhood were built by Garand Homes. Together with the Lakeview neighbourhood south of Corkstown and the Rocky Point neighbourhood north of Carling, the area is part of the Crystal Beach/Lakeview Community Association.[1]
