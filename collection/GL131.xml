It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places encompassing 12.3 acres (50,000 m2) along the Southern California coast. It was listed on the National Register not only because of its significance but also because of the 46 cottages located there which were built in the 1920s and 1930s.[2] These cottages are perfect examples of Southern California coastal development in the early 20th century and were preserved by the Crystal Cove Alliance. Since the restoration, the cottages have been open to the public for overnight stays.[3]

      <p id="GL131_003_002" num_links="3">Up until the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries, the region was a series of native villages built around two different natural springs. The natives were then drafted to <link wikipedia="Mission_San_Gabriel_Arcángel" osm="546830454" type="way">Mission San Gabriel</link> and <link wikipedia="Mission_San_Juan_Capistrano" osm="70107365" type="way">Mission San Juan Capistrano</link>, which was later known as "Rancho San Joaquin", until it went into debt and was sold in 1864 to James Irvine, a financier from <link wikipedia="San_Francisco" osm="26819236 111968 396487" type="node relation relation">San Francisco</link>, along with three other ranchers, however in 1876, when their sheep stock began to fail from drought, poor wool, and the increasingly competitive marketplace, James Irvine bought out his partners prior to his death. His son, James Irvine II, then inherited the ranch and began to expand the production of the land by leasing it to agriculturally diverse farmers, and formed "The Irvine Company" in 1894.[4] Being a favorite spot to James Irvine II, he allowed his friends and family as well as employees to build cottages on the area that we now refer to as Crystal Cove. As cottages began to undergo renovations and become more permanent residences, the owners were offered a choice by the Irvine Company to either move the cottages elsewhere or to hand over ownership and allow them to be leased by the company.[5] These cottages were developed by the Irvine Company and the location was called the Crystal Cove Community.[6]  In 1927, the Irvine Co. leased a portion of the area to a businessman who sold propane to coastal farmers and became a camping site named "Tyrone's Camp". Trailers replaced tent camping in the 1940s and in 1954, it was renamed El Morro.[7]  About 290 mobile home trailers on the beachfront and inland area were primary homes for some families up to four generations. In 2006, after 26 years of litigation, the California Coastal Commission, who purchased the property in 1979, evicted the tenants and demolished the El Morro Village mobile home park converting the private community into a day-use and overnight campground.[8][9][10][11]  The area was renovated to also include a visitors center for tourist information, dining areas along the beachfront, cultural center, museums and the Park and Marine Research Facility.[3] The Crystal Cove Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places site, inside the park contains 46 beach cottages from the 1920s and 1930s, of which 29 have been restored.  21 of these cottages are available for rent.[4][12]    The house from the Bette Midler movie Beaches is located in Crystal Cove.[12] 
One of the fun traditions at the restaurant in the Crystal Cove Historic District has its historical roots dating back to the 1940s.  "Cove-ite's", Crystal Cove residents, led by Doc Shearer, who also was the leader of Los Angeles's  Shriners' Top Hat Band, would salute the raising of Doc's Martini flag as Doc Shearer played reveille on his trumpet.  That historic moment is re-created every day at 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM, by the Beachcomber Restaurant to signal the official start of cocktail hour and the serving of Martinis.

It is home to the Mexican Stock Exchange, the important tourist attractions of the historic center and Zona Rosa, and various skyscrapers such as the <link wikipedia="Torre_Mayor" osm="217330156" type="way">Torre Mayor</link> and the Mexican headquarters of HSBC. It also contains numerous museums, libraries, government offices, markets and other commercial centers which can bring in as many as 5 million people each day to work, shop or visit cultural sites. This area has had problems with urban decay, especially in the historic center. Efforts to revitalize the historic center and some other areas have been ongoing since the 1990s, by both government and private entities. Such efforts have resulted in better public parks, such as the Alameda Central, which was renovated; the modification of streets such as 16 de Septiembre and Madero that have become exclusive for pedestrians.

The dam was named in honor of George Culmback, a former mayor of Everett.[4]

It was remapped during 1926–29 by Discovery Investigations personnel and renamed "West Cumberland Bay". The shortened form West Bay was simultaneously used. Following the South Georgia Survey, 1951–52, the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee proposed that the name be altered to Cumberland West Bay and that all other names be rejected. This change brings together information about the whole of Cumberland Bay together in indexes.
