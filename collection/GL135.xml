These developments have resulted in large scale tree-felling. However, Cooke Town still manages to retain some of its colonial charm, and is called the nicest place in the Cantonment by Bangalore historian Peter Colaco.[1] Cooke Town is a posh neighbourhood with plenty of greenery, parks, educational institutions, hospitals and is at close proximity to the Bangalore East Railway Station and the Bangalore CBD. According to Colliers International, Cooke Town is one of Bangalore's most costliest neighbourhoods, with the cost of property being in the range to INR 60000-65000 per sq.ft (in January 2020), just slightly lesser than the Bangalore CBD.[2][3][4][5]

Of the few estates that Frank Lloyd Wright developed, it is one of his largest and most elaborate prairie school-homes ever built.

The other two are the <link wikipedia="Dana–Thomas_House" osm="123229302" type="way">Dana-Thomas House</link> and the <link wikipedia="Darwin_D._Martin_House" osm="1342600765 5459931" type="node relation">Darwin D.

The raised second floor includes three zones: The public area (living room and dining room), the bedroom wing (with its pendant guest wing) and finally the kitchen and servants areas.  The original residence was over-9000-square-feet and built on a ten-acre parcel.  The entrance halls, playroom and sewing room are on the ground floor. An entire complex of interrelated buildings with extensive raised and sunken gardens was designed by landscape architect Jens Jensen. The main structure of the Avery Coonley Estate is the public-living room wing, located on Bloomingbank Road and behind that facing Scottswood Road is the bedroom wing of the mansion. The complex also includes a separate stable-coach house and gardener's cottage (1911). Along with the <link wikipedia="Robie_House" osm="125667497" type="way">Robie House</link>, the Coonley Estate represents the maturation of Wright's Prairie Style, typified by wide overhanging eaves, bands of art glass casement windows, free-flowing interior spaces and the harmonious blending of site and structure.

The animals that the visitors could contemplate at the opening were eagles, chickens, ducks, owls, rabbits, a fox, a seal in a bathtub and a turtle in a bucket. In the early years the zoo focused on showing as many different types of animals as possible, but as animal welfare later became an issue, the number of different species has dropped in favour of more space to each animal. In 1901 the zoo had a human display with 25 <link wikipedia="India" osm="424314145 304716" type="node relation">Indians</link>- men, women and children- in an exhibition where the "brown exotic" people went about their daily lives in palm tree leaf huts constructed in the middle of the zoo.[5]
One of the most notable animals kept there was a male slow worm that lived there from 1892 to 1946 (for 54 years, which is a record among lizards).[6][7]

Copper Canyon was founded in April 1973. Irving, Texas was the first to have their eyes set on annexing the land of now Copper Canyon and Flower Mound. Residents, Bob “Shack” Shackelford, Fielding “Dutch” Schulz, and Paul Vickery were first to recognize this threat to their simple rural living. These men convinced Bill Ferris, Bob Woodin, Tom Murray and Bob Allen to incorporate the town in an effort to preserve the rural atmosphere and freedom of the community. With the threats of the expansive ranch land being annexed into today’s Flower Mound, Texas and facing increasing taxes and regulations, the founding fathers knew it was time to act.

The brick Greek Revival building was constructed in 1864 to house the Union Guard of Copperopolis, the town's regiment of the Union Army. Copperopolis largely owed its existence to the war; the town grew due to a boom in local copper mining in 1860, which stemmed from the Union Army's need for copper ammunition. The armory served a variety of purposes for the Union Guard; at the building, new soldiers were enlisted, training was conducted, and arms and supplies were stored. Military balls, victory celebrations, and the local funeral ceremonies for <link wikipedia="Abraham_Lincoln" osm="95139887" type="way">Abraham Lincoln</link> also took place in the armory. The armory also held an 1837 bronze cannon, which was used for ceremonial purposes and arms training; the cannon remains in the building and is one of the few American bronze cannons from the era in California. After the war, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows bought the building, which they converted to a social hall. In 1940, the armory became a community center.[2]

However, there is no evidence that Montour ever lived on this tract.  The first permanent white settler in Coraopolis was Capt. Robert Vance, who settled in the vicinity of Montour's tract around 1773, just prior to the beginning of the American Revolution.  Vance, a Virginian, had been a member of the regiment commanded by George Washington at the Braddock expedition during the French and Indian War.  For the protection of himself and his neighbors, of whom several arrived within a few years, Vance had a log stockade built with a stone blockhouse to protect the area against Indian raids.  This was known as Vance Fort (or Fort Vance).  The site of the fort was around present-day Broadway and Chestnut streets, near Second Avenue.  Over time the community grew and developed, and it became known as Middletown in the 1800s, either because it was situated midway between <link wikipedia="Pittsburgh" osm="34184938 188553" type="node relation">Pittsburgh</link> and <link wikipedia="Beaver,_Pennsylvania" osm="154123224 187291" type="node relation">Beaver, Pennsylvania</link>, or perhaps after an early settler named Alexander Middleton who supposedly ran "Middleton's Tavern" in the area.[5]

      <p id="GL135_500_002" num_links="5">Corfinium was the chief city of the Paeligni, situated in the valley of the <link wikipedia="Aterno-Pescara" osm="2506845" type="relation">Aternus</link>, near the point where that river's course suddenly makes a sharp turn and runs from southeasterly to northeasterly on towards the <link wikipedia="Adriatic_Sea" osm="9350128" type="relation">Adriatic Sea</link>. It was distant 7 miles from Sulmo (modern <link wikipedia="Sulmona" osm="41721" type="relation">Sulmona</link>), and 30 from <link wikipedia="Alba_Fucens" osm="158853556" type="way">Alba Fucens</link> by the Via Valeria. There can be no doubt that Corfinium was from an early period the capital city of the Paeligni, and one of the chief towns in this part of Italy; but no mention of its name is found in history until the outbreak of the Social War, in 90 BCE, when it was selected by the confederates to be their common capital, and the seat of their government. It was probably to the importance of its situation in a military point of view that it was mainly indebted for this distinction; but the allied nations seem to have destined it to be the permanent capital of Italy, and the rival of Rome, as they changed its name to Italica, and adorned it with a new and spacious forum and senate house, and other public buildings of a style corresponding to its intended greatness.[1] But before the end of the second year of the war they were compelled to abandon their new capital, and transfer the seat of government to Aesernia (modern <link wikipedia="Isernia" osm="67283753 41385" type="node relation">Isernia</link>).[2] The fate of Corfinium after this is not mentioned, but it probably fell into the hands of the Romans without resistance, and in consequence did not suffer; for we find it at the outbreak of the Civil War between Julius Caesar and Pompey, 49 BCE, still retaining its position as a city of importance and a strong fortress. On this account it was occupied by L. Domitius with 31 cohorts[3], and was the only place which offered any effectual resistance to the arms of Caesar during his advance through Italy. Nor was it reduced by force, but the disaffection which rapidly spread among his officers compelled Domitius to surrender after a siege of only seven days.[4] Along with the garrison, several important Republican personages were also captured; Caesar released these after obtaining their oaths of loyalty, oaths many promptly broke.[5]
