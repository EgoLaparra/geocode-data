Wyatt exhibited the design at the Royal Academy in 1783. A slightly modified design was completed in 1786 under the supervision of George Dance the Younger (1741–1825), as Wyatt had a poor reputation for supervising the execution of his work.[5] For obscure reasons the mausoleum was never consecrated so no bodies were laid to rest there.
