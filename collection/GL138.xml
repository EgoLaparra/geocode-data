      <p id="GL138_002_002" num_links="3">Davy Crockett grew up in the hills and river valleys of East Tennessee, where he gained a reputation for hunting and storytelling.  After rising to the rank of colonel in the <link wikipedia="Lawrence_County,_Tennessee" osm="1848185" type="relation">Lawrence County, Tennessee</link> militia, Crockett was elected to the Tennessee state legislature in 1821.  In 1827, Crockett was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time.  As a congressman, Crockett vehemently opposed many of the policies of President <link wikipedia="Andrew_Jackson" osm="2511267" type="relation">Andrew Jackson</link>, most notably the Indian Removal Act.  Crockett's opposition to Jackson's policies led to his defeat in the 1835 elections, prompting his angry departure to <link wikipedia="Texas" osm="316998356 114690" type="node relation">Texas</link> shortly thereafter.

The museum's name was changed on October 6, 2011 from the Ball State Museum of Art to the David Owsley Museum of Art in honor of David T. Owsley, grandson of Frank C. Ball (one of the five Ball Brothers), to recognize his donation of over 2,300 works of art and planned gift of $5 million.[1][2]
Since departments within the Fine Arts Building relocated to other areas on Ball State's campus, the museum has expanded its galleries, beginning in early-mid-2012 and ending in 2013.[3]

The creek was named after George Mercer Dawson by a member of his land survey team when they passed through the area in August 1879. Once a small farming community, Dawson Creek became a regional centre after the western terminus of the Northern Alberta Railways was extended there in 1932.

</p>
      <p id="GL138_381_002" num_links="2">The history of De Gekroonde Poelenburg is rather complicated involving several distinct windmills. The first windmill on the original location of the first De Poelenburg in Zaandam-Oost was mentioned in 1733. It was named after its owner Pieter Jochemsz. Poelenburg. This mill burned down in 1903 and was replaced by a windmill from <link wikipedia="Koog_aan_de_Zaan" osm="337727" type="relation">Koog aan de Zaan</link> called De Locomotief (The Locomotive) which was renamed to De Gekroonde Poelenburg after the move. De Locomotief was newly built in Koog aan de Zaan in 1867 to replace the 200-year-old De Groene Jager (The Green Hunter) that had to be dismantled for the construction of a railway line by the HSM. Hence the name of the new mill. De Gekroonde Poelenburg, formerly De Locomotief, was working until 1950 after which it fell into disrepair. It was acquired by Vereniging De Zaansche Molen and moved to the <link wikipedia="Zaanse_Schans" osm="177095326" type="way">Zaanse Schans</link> in 1963. It was re-erected at the site of pealing windmill De Grootvorst that had burned down in 1928. The restored mill turned out to be very hard to wind and attempts to use this mill commercially were abandoned in 1966. Since then it is operated by volunteers. The winding problem was solved years later. In hindsight a misunderstanding on the weight distribution of paltrok mills may have caused the problem. It is now known that most of the weight should be carried by the central post and not evenly divided between post and roller ring (see below). Another misunderstanding was put right in 2005 when the black tar coating of 1963 was replaced by the original bright green paint.[2]

De Grote Molen was built to replace it by millwright Gerben van Wieren of <link wikipedia="Jannum" osm="2648705" type="relation">Jannum</link>. It was originally built with two Archimedes' screws.[2] The mill was at one time equipped with Patent sails. In 1934, one of the Archimedes' screws was transferred to the Kleine Molen. The spurwheel needed to drive the second screw was removed around 1986 and later reused in gristmill <link wikipedia="De_Vlijt,_Koudum" osm="293122440" type="way">De Vlijt</link>.[3] A centrifugal pump was installed in 1943 and the mill ceased to work.[2] The mill was restored in 1959 and again in 1975, at which time the patent system sails were replaced by commons sails.[3] In 1977 it was sold to Stichting De Fryske Mole (English: Frisian Mills Foundation). A further restoration was undertaken in 1994.[4] In 2010 and 2011 major restoration work was done. Amongst others it was decided to repair the riveted stocks dating from 1902 instead of replacing them with new welded steel stocks and to refit the patent system which had been removed in 1975.

      <p id="GL138_489_002" num_links="2">De Otter, probably earlier known as De Kleine Otter (The Small <link wikipedia="Otter" osm="147147086" type="way">Otter</link>) was built in or shortly after 1631. It is the only one left over from a group of sawmills built in the area between the Kostverlorenvaart canal and the Singelgracht. Gerrit van der Beyl bought the mill in 1817. The firm Van der Beyl expanded their property by acquiring several neighboring sawmills. City expansion started to threaten the mills by the end of the 19th century and during several decades the mills were one by one dismantled. De Otter was probably in production until the start of the 20th century. In 1925 the sails were removed after the wooden windshaft was torn but the rest of the mill remained standing. The last operational wind powered sawmill, De Eenhoorn (The Unicorn), located north of De Otter, shut down in 1929 and was dismantled in 1931, leaving De Otter as the only remainder of this local industry. De Otter was placed on the list of monuments in 1977. The mill was restored to working order after a two-year restoration project started in 1994 after which it was regularly running. However the location of the mill for catching the wind was already difficult in the buildup area of Amsterdam and it got worse by the construction of large apartment buildings close to the windmill. Stichting Houtzaagmolen De Otter, as owner of the mill, therefor proposed to move the mill to <link wikipedia="Uitgeest" osm="46874557 290108 290111" type="node relation relation">Uitgeest</link>. However the local government had to give permission to move a Rijksmonument and it turned out the local city council was strongly opposed to this idea. The fierce discussion became the subject of several court cases between 2006 and 2011. For the time being De Otter is still in its original location but not being operated.[1][2]

On the Ferrari-map from the 1770s, the place appears as a rural area with scattered hamlets and country estates. In the place of the current center, the map still shows the hamlet Pintestraete.
