The Gilmours left Craigmillar in the 18th century, and the castle fell into ruin. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.[1]

      <p id="GL139_265_001" num_links="2">The Crater Glacier[1] (also known as Tulutson Glacier) is a geologically young glacier that is located on <link wikipedia="Mount_St._Helens" osm="356546327" type="node">Mount St. Helens</link>, in the U.S. state of <link wikipedia="Washington_(state)" osm="34724864 165479" type="node relation">Washington</link>. The glacier formed after the 1980 Eruption and due to its location, the body of ice grew rapidly, unknown to the public for nearly 20 years. The glacier once contained ice caves in the smooth ice before the 2004-2008 volcanic activity. The growth of the lava dome and volcanic eruptions from 2004 to 2008 significantly altered the appearance of the glacier.[2] In the same time period, several agencies decided to put an official name on the glacier which, at first, was Tulutson Glacier. A later decision made Crater Glacier the official glacier name. Despite the volcanic activity, the glacier continued to advance and by mid-2008, the glacier completely encircled the lava domes.[2][3][4][5] In addition, new glaciers (rock or ice) have formed around Crater Glacier as well.[6]

</p>
      <p id="GL139_265_002" num_links="4">True to its name, the glacier lies inside the north-facing crater left by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens and the glacier's elevation is about 6,794 ft (2,071 m).[7] A massive central lava dome emplaced from 1980 to 1987 occupies the center of the crater, and the glacier formed in the shape of a <link wikipedia="Horseshoe" osm="6357070804" type="node">horseshoe</link> around the dome, with two terminal moraines on the eastern and western sides.  Heavy winter snowfall, repeated snow avalanches, rockfalls, and sun-shading by the surrounding cliffs to the south, led to the exceptionally rapid growth of this glacier.[8] Thus, the glacier composition is estimated to be 60% ice and 40%rock,[9] with an average thickness of 328 feet (100 m)[10] and a maximum thickness of around 656 feet (200 m); nearly as deep as <link wikipedia="Mount_Rainier" osm="1744903493" type="node">Mount Rainier</link>'s <link wikipedia="Carbon_Glacier" osm="5544150" type="relation">Carbon Glacier</link>.[2] None of the ice is older than the year 1980, but by 2001 the volume of the new glacier was about 40%-50% as large as all the pre–1980 glaciers combined.[11]  The surface of the glacier looks dark and dirty in the summer due to the numerous rockfalls from the steep, unstable crater walls along with ash from eruptions, all of which help to insulate and protect the growing glacier.[12][13][14][15][16] The 2004-2008 volcanic activity created a series of domes that nearly split the glacier into two lobes at the south end of the crater.[12] In spite of the four-year lava dome building period, the glacier remains <link wikipedia="North_America" osm="36966063" type="node">North America</link>'s youngest and fastest growing glacier.[17] With the joining of the termini on the north end of Crater Glacier in May 2008, the body of ice completely encircles the lava domes.[4][5] Meltwater from the glacier gives rise to Loowit Creek.[18]

In 1919 the U.S. Department of the Interior sold the building to the city of Okmulgee.[3] It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961.[2][4] In November 2010 the city sold the building back to the tribe for $3.2 million.[5] The building currently houses the Creek Council House Museum, with artifacts and exhibits about the history of the Muscogee tribe and the arts and crafts of other Native American tribes.

During the American Civil War, tribal unity was tested when many tribe members participated on both sides of the conflict, despite attempts by leaders of the tribe to keep it neutral.

The next year a double-log two-story council house was constructed to conduct tribal business. On October 17, 1877 an act was passed by the council and approved by Chief Ward Coachman appropriating $10,000 for the construction of a new capitol building of stone or brick upon the site of the log council house. On January 10, 1878 the old Council House was sold for $60, with the tribe reconvening at the new Council House on September 23. The new Council House contained separate chambers for the executive and judicial branches of the government, with the legislative branch divided into the House of Kings and House of Warriors.

It is the capital of the <link wikipedia="Province_of_Cremona" osm="43893" type="relation">province of Cremona</link> and the seat of the local city and province governments. The city of Cremona is especially noted for its musical history and traditions, including some of the earliest and most renowned luthiers, such as Giuseppe Guarneri, Antonio Stradivari, Francesco Rugeri, Vincenzo Rugeri, and several members of the Amati family.[7]

</p>
      <p id="GL139_415_002" num_links="5">Cremona is first mentioned in history as a settlement of the Cenomani, a Gallic (Celtic) tribe that arrived in the <link wikipedia="Po_(river)" osm="2146941" type="relation">Po</link> valley around 400 BC. However, the name Cremona most likely dates back  to earlier settlers and puzzled the ancients, who gave many fanciful interpretations. In 218 BC the Romans established on that spot their first military outpost (a colonia) north of the Po river, and kept the old name. Cremona and nearby Placentia (modern <link wikipedia="Piacenza" osm="1944059487 43981" type="node relation">Piacenza</link>, on the south bank of the Po), were founded in the same year, as bases for penetration into what became the Roman Province of Gallia Cisalpina (Cisalpine Gaul). Cremona quickly grew into one of the largest towns in northern Italy, as it was on the main road connecting <link wikipedia="Genoa" osm="66586322 44875" type="node relation">Genoa</link> to <link wikipedia="Aquileia" osm="66503315 179240" type="node relation">Aquileia</link>, the <link wikipedia="Via_Postumia" osm="588219621" type="way">Via Postumia</link>. It supplied troops to Julius Caesar and benefited from his rule, but later supported Marcus Iunius Brutus and the Senate in their conflict with Augustus, who, having won, in 40 BC confiscated Cremona's land and redistributed it to his men. The famous poet Virgil, who went to school in Cremona, had to forfeit his ancestral farm ("too close to wretched Cremona"), but later regained it. The city's prosperity continued to increase until 69 AD, when it was sacked and destroyed in the Second Battle of Bedriacum by the troops of Vespasian under command of Marcus Antonius Primus, fighting to install him as Emperor against his rival Vitellius. Cremona was rebuilt with the help of the new emperor Vespasian, but it seems to have failed to regain its former prosperity as it disappeared from history until the 6th century, when it resurfaced as a military outpost of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire during the Gothic War.
