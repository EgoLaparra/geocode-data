      <p id="GL139_013_001" num_links="2">The first paper mill in the Zaan region was built in 1605.[3] De Schoolmeester was built in 1692.[1] It is also known by the nickname De Gauwdief.[4] The name De Schoolmeester (English: The Schoolmaster) probably denotes the occupation of one of the founders. The mill originally made grey paper. In 1778, the mill was powering two Hollander beaters. In 1852, the mill was bought by Gerbrand de Jong, who owned another wind-powered paper mill, De Kaarsenmaker at <link wikipedia="Zaandijk" osm="337726" type="relation">Zaandijk</link>. He bought another nearby paper mill, De Vergulde Bijenkorf in 1854. In 1871, the mills were owned by Gebroeders de Jong, who demolished De Kaarsenmaker in the autumn of 1873. In 1877, the mill was modernised and a steam engine installed as auxiliary power. This meant that the mill was uninsureable against fire. In 1902, the nearby De Vergulde Bijenkorf burnt down. A steam driven paper factory was erected to replace it. This factory was able to make white paper. A fire started at De Schoolmeester in 1915 but was extinguished.[5] In 1948, the steam engine was replaced by a <link wikipedia="Ford_Motor_Company" osm="170973946 232375504" type="way way">Ford</link> gas engine. On 1 March 1949, the drying sheds were damaged in a storm, with over 30 metres (98 ft) of them being affected. They were rebuilt shorter than they had been previously.[4] On 28 August 1957, De Schoolmeester was sold to Vereniging van Nederlandsche Papierfabrikanten by the de Jongs.[5] In 1964, the gas engine was replaced by a Bernard diesel engine.[4] In 1977, the mill was bought by Vereniging Zaansche Molens.[3] The diesel engine was replaced by an electric motor in 1979.[4] A four-year restoration of the mill at a cost of €450,000 was completed in June 2002. The work included complete renewal of the drying sheds.[3]

Between 1829-1854 almost thirty tribes were assigned reservations in what would become Kansas Territory. The Shawnee Methodist Mission was built in the De Soto area to minister to the tribe.[8] A reserve was established in Kansas and soon other Shawnee from as far east as Ohio would join the reservation.

In the 1970s, it was decided that Nijeveen should have a windmill again, and a search was made for a suitable replacement.[2] De Sterrenberg was originally built at <link wikipedia="Weener" osm="190681052 1255862" type="node relation">Weener</link>, <link wikipedia="Lower_Saxony" osm="1673514242 62771 454192" type="node relation relation">Lower Saxony</link>, <link wikipedia="Germany" osm="1683325355 51477 62781" type="node relation relation">Germany</link> in 1786. The mill was dismantled in 1976 and rebuilt brick by brick in Nijeveen.[3] The mill is named for its former owners in Germany, the Sterrenberg family. On 13 January 1977, the smock was placed on the new brick base. The millwright responsible for the rebuild was the firm Schakel of <link wikipedia="Exmorra" osm="2658312" type="relation">Exmorra</link>, <link wikipedia="Friesland" osm="4289960493 47381" type="node relation">Friesland</link>. The base was built by the firm Elphenhof of <link wikipedia="De_Wijk" osm="2680758" type="relation">De Wijk</link>.[2] The official opening ceremony on 11 August 1977 was performed by Prince Claus. The mill was damaged in a storm in March 1995 with various shutters being blown out of the sails.[3] The mill was repaired by the end of that year. Major repairs to the sails were undertaken in 2002-03.[2]

The windmill must have had a tailpole for winding as parts for the tail were delivered during construction. There is also a wear line on the brickwork where a roller once supported the tail construction. The current internal winding winches resemble those fitted in windmills in <link wikipedia="North_Holland" osm="4289948988 47654" type="node relation">Noord-Holland</link> and not those in the older tower mills of Zeddam and <link wikipedia="De_Buitenmolen,_Zevenaar" osm="271334134" type="way">Zevenaar</link>.[1]

As a result of contamination, Deer Lake was designated as a catch and release site, as fish caught in the lake were unsafe for consumption.[2]
In late 2014, the lake was delisted as an AOC, one of the first two lakes to be delisted in the state and one of only three AOCs to achieve the status.[3] According to the EPA, the restrictions on fishing were removed as well.[4]
