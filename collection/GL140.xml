      <p id="GL140_039_001" num_links="2">Del Norte is named from the river Rio Grande del Norte, "large river of the north".[9]  The Utes were the first people to live here, particularly in the summers because of the abundance of wild game, plants, water, and timber in the area.  However, winters were too cold and harsh for them to settle permanently.  Under Mexican jurisdiction, some Hispanic families moved into the area in the early to mid-19th century as part of land grants to help the Mexican government occupy the territory, but no large-scale settlements could be established because the Utes were very weary of settlement, and would chase off many people who attempted to do so.  The most successful early settlement was called 'La Loma', established a few miles east of where the current town-site is today.  This area was chosen because there was a particular section of the Rio Grande here where it could be crossed safely and easily.  American settlement began in the early 1870s by prospectors who were searching the nearby mountains for minerals such as gold and silver, particularly near Bennett Peak.  The San Juan Mountains were one of the last regions in Colorado where miners were allowed to explore and prospect for minerals, but were finally able to do so after the Brunot Treaty was signed between the U.S. government and the Utes.  Once the mines near Summitville proved profitable, Del Norte was officially established around 1874 in order to serve as a base camp for the mines not just in Summitville, but also in nearby <link wikipedia="Creede,_Colorado" osm="5505245" type="relation">Creede</link> and <link wikipedia="Lake_City,_Colorado" osm="6915189" type="relation">Lake City</link>.  Miners quickly moved into the area, and they were followed by ranchers and farmers - many of these original ranching families still operate and live in the Del Norte area to this day.  After the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, mining operations quickly became unprofitable and ceased.  The 'glory days' of Del Norte ended as quickly as they began, but the community still survived because of ranching and agriculture.[10]  There were talks in southern Colorado throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s to secede from the state of Colorado and create the state of San Juan, with Del Norte acting as this proposed state's capital city, however this secession movement died quickly.  Del Norte would see cycles of boom and bust throughout the 20th century, but has recently become a blossoming community due to the abundance of recreational activities provided by the area's unique geography; such as mountain biking, hiking, rock climbing, fishing, hunting, camping, etc.  Del Norte is also one of the communities which provides lodging for nearby Wolf Creek Ski Area.  Grande Avenue, the main street through Del Norte, still has many of the facades on its store fronts from the 1800s, reminding its residents and tourists of the town's historic past.

      <p id="GL140_092_002" num_links="4">Delaware is recognized as the "Snow Capital of the Midwest". The Keweenaw County Road Commission maintains an unofficial record of snowfall at this location. The annual average, dating back to 1910, is around 240 inches. This is largely a result of Lake-effect snow. This average is the greatest of any location in the <link wikipedia="Great_Lakes" osm="1124369" type="relation">Great Lakes</link> snow belts.

In the winter of 1978-79, the Delaware station measured a record 390 inches of snow. Measurements are taken once per day at this station. Official National Weather Service stations measure snowfall every six hours. This procedural difference leads to systematic underestimation of snowfall at Delaware due to compaction of the new snow over the 24-hour period. Helping to illustrate this point, Mount Bohemia, a ski resort in neary <link wikipedia="Lac_La_Belle,_Michigan" osm="153396201" type="node">Lac La Belle, Michigan</link>, reports an annual average of 273 inches.

William Martin and Norman Isham, under the direction of the State Buildings and Grounds Commission, created by Governor C. Douglass Buck in 1931 during the Great Depression. Initially the commission was awarded to Isham, but his appointment was protested by Alfred Victor Du Pont (on the grounds that Isham was not a resident of Delaware); therefore, local architect Martin was brought in.[1] The influence of Isham is clear when one notes the resemblance of many architectural details to <link wikipedia="Old_Colony_House" osm="560756423" type="way">Old Colony House</link> in <link wikipedia="Newport,_Rhode_Island" osm="158837846 191230" type="node relation">Newport, Rhode Island</link>, a building which Isham had also restored in 1932.[1]

It was originally named Dalles Spring, from a French word referring to water, but railroad personnel later shortened the name for telegraphic efficiency.[3] It possessed a water tower, a reservoir, and numerous homes where railroad employees and their families resided from at least 1920 until 1940. The inhabitants were primarily Irish, Scot and Greek immigrants. Water was obtained from springs located as far as 12 miles (19 km) away in nearby mountains (Delle Ranch located along the east bench of Skull Valley being the primary) and piped to the site. After diesel powered engines were introduced, Delle continued as a site station for railroad employees in charge of track upkeep between <link wikipedia="Wendover,_Utah" osm="150955294 198968" type="node relation">Wendover</link>, Utah and <link wikipedia="Salt_Lake_City" osm="150935219 198770" type="node relation">Salt Lake City</link>.

The first Sultan was known as Raden Patah, who was a vassal of Majapahit until 1478.[3] The city was founded as a seaport, next to the now-nonexistent Muria Palaeostrait separating Java from Muria Island (now Mount Muria), although silting has now entirely turned the waterway into land.[4] The Sultanate expanded in the expense of the declining Majapahit and its fragments, conquering the coastal region of Tuban around 1527 and reaching inland areas as far as <link wikipedia="Malang" osm="2518173352 9674151" type="node relation">Malang</link> by 1546.[3] As the capital, the city became an important center for trade and the spread of Islam across the island, and a base of the semi-apocryphal Wali Sanga. Upon the decline of the Sultanate, the region was conquered in turn by the Pajang and Mataram Sultanates.[5] The seaport began to silt sometime in the 17th century, diminishing the region's importance as a seaport.

Construction assistance was provided by the British Government, but the basic design was by a Guyanese, Capt. John Patrick Coghlan. The bridge was only designed to last 10 years, yet it is still going strong.[1][2] Tolls are collected only in one direction of travel even though the bridge handles one lane of traffic in each direction. Traffic going west to east pays no toll.

The Demerara's estuary is narrow and the flowrate is rapid. This scouring action maintains a 5-to-6-metre-deep direct channel to the ocean. The river's deep brown color is primarily the result of the massive quantities of silt carried from upriver by the powerful currents. So powerful are these currents, that the ocean retains the Demerara's brown color for a considerable distance out to sea.

The fortress was located close to the boundary between the Novgorod Republic and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and it was at least twice sieged by Muscovite troops. In 1441, the Muscovites did not manage to conquer Demon, but in the 1470s they conquered and destroyed the fortress. After the subsequent fall of Novgorod, Demon was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In the 17th century, Demon went into decline, and a new settlement was founded nearby, which was known as Demyansky Pogost, and later as Demyansk. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by <link wikipedia="Peter_the_Great" osm="6204100696" type="node">Peter the Great</link>, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. Between 1772 and 1824, Demyansk was a part of Starorussky Uyezd of Novgorod Viceroyalty (since 1796 of Novgorod Governorate). In 1824, it was chartered and became the center of Demyansky Uyezd, which was split off Starorussky Uyezd.[11]

In the Ottoman census of 1831, the village had a Turkish Cypriot majority, with 17 Turkish Cypriot and 8 Greek Cypriot male inhabitants recorded. However, in 1891, both ethnic groups constituted half the village's population, with 82 Turkish Cypriot and 84 Greek Cypriots. Between 1891 and 1946, the village's Turkish Cypriot population did not increase, whilst the Greek Cypriot population continually increased. In 1960, Greek Cypriots constituted 61.5% of the population of 324 people (196 Greek Cypriots, 128 Turkish Cypriots). The Turkish Cypriots of the village fled to secure Turkish Cypriot enclaves in Fotta, <link wikipedia="Krini,_Cyprus" osm="299290548" type="node">Krini</link>, Ortaköy and <link wikipedia="Lefka" osm="306213498" type="node">Lefka</link> in 1964, in the wake of intercommunal violence. During the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, Greek Cypriot inhabitants also fled the village as the Turkish army advanced to the village, but they returned after the army withdrew. Turkish Cypriot inhabitants were relocated to Şirinevler (Agios Ermolaos), where they were given land. Today, the original Greek Cypriot inhabitants live in the village, while the Turkish Cypriot quarter lies in ruins.[2]
