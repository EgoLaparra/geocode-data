      <p id="GL140_036_001" num_links="3">Creston sprang up with the arrival of the Central Washington Railroad in 1889.

Huson and registered with the state on June 23 of that year. The first structure in town was a small store building moved to the site by Henry Verfurth from the nearby village of Sherman, 5 miles northwest of Creston. A post office was established shortly thereafter whose jurisdiction extended to the <link wikipedia="Columbia_River" osm="2183775" type="relation">Columbia River</link> on the North and the railroad tracks on the South with ten miles East and West. Henry Verfurth was appointed as postmaster. Following the Panic of 1893 and the bankruptcy of the town site owner, Creston remained dormant until a bumper wheat crop in 1897 gave a boost to the regional economy, bringing thousands of new settlers to the region.

Despite the passage of federal and state school desegregation laws, Attucks was the city's only high school with a single-race student body in 1953, largely due to residential segregation, and remained a segregated school until in 1971 (although some historians suggested that it occurred in 1968). Attucks was converted to a junior high school in 1986, due to declining enrollment, and a middle school in 1993. It became a medical magnet high school in 2006, partially due to the school's proximity to the campus of the Indiana University School of Medicine and its associated hospitals.

This new town and planned community was founded at the same time as <link wikipedia="Reston,_Virginia" osm="2240795956 206748" type="node relation">Reston, Virginia</link> (April 17, 1964) and <link wikipedia="Columbia,_Maryland" osm="158223559 133606" type="node relation">Columbia, Maryland</link> (1967). Crofton would be anchored by a community golf course, which later became the Crofton Country Club. Crofton was officially founded in the fall of 1964. The company considered picking an English name for the new town that "sounds well and implies that this is a pleasant place to live." It ended up picking the name "Crofton", named after a small township in Cumberland County, England. The <link wikipedia="Crofton,_Cumbria" osm="4405049043 5919960378" type="node node">English town</link> was originally called Croft-town, derived from the word "Croft", as the town standing upon the Crofts. Originally an exclusive gated community, Crofton's gates were opened and they now only serve as a symbol for the community.

The castle was built in two phases; Sir Robert Blake constructed the tower between 1651 and 1652 in the aftermath of the Parliamentary invasion of the islands at the end of the English Civil War, and Master Gunner Abraham Tovey added the gun platform during the War of Jenkins' Ear around 1739. The tower fell into disuse soon afterwards, and in the 21st century is managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.

Key landmarks are the Crook Log Inn, now a licensed restaurant, on the southern side of the A207 and a sports centre on the northern side.  In 2005 the Crook Log leisure centre was expanded to include an eight–lane 25 metre indoor swimming pool, a teaching pool and changing facilities. The new centre was opened by Her Majesty the Queen on 26 July 2005.[1] An existing and long established swimming pool across the road, at that time known as Splashworld, was then demolished. The site was redeveloped with 52 apartments and the complex was named "The Old Baths". Other nearby public amenities include a youth centre and an adult education centre. Also in the area are Crook Log Primary School and The Crook Log guest house. An amateur theatre called the Edward Alderton Theatre is in Crook Log. Actor Roger Moore and world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis are former residents of this area.[2]

As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.[4] During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.[4] Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Skagit River.

Crooswijk also has an industrial past. Jamin [nl], Heineken Brewery and many abattoirs were established there. These industries have given way to housing. On the Crooswijksesingel is only the monumental building of Heineken still standing. Crooswijk is one of the original people's neighborhoods of Rotterdam (unlike many other people's neighborhoods in the city, which originally were independent villages) and the district is strongly associated with the 'real' Rotterdammer. The Crooswijk is sometimes called: "The poorest part of the Netherlands", or: "The poorest part of Rotterdam". This is because the average income of the people living there is lower than other places.

It was also known as Croppers Depot. Their post office [2] is closed. The town of Cropper (Population Cal. at 205 in 2010) is located in northeast Shelby County, Kentucky. The origin of its name comes from the town's founder James Cropper, a blacksmith and store keeper who was the first person to build a house there sometime in the 1790s. He also was the town's first postmaster. The majority of Cropper's original citizens were members of the Low Dutch colony who were in the area as early as 1786. In 1807, a new group of settlers from Virginia increased the town's population. In 1855, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L and N) along with a depot opened on the east end of town. A hotel soon opened afterwards. This railroad line was closed in the early 1970s. Another occurrence, in 1855, was the founding of Union Grove Church. This church had three different denominations that included Christian, Methodist and Baptist. The only cemetery in Cropper is on the church grounds. In June 1900, the Baptist separated from the Union Church, and by 1903 it had its own building. In 1967, the Union Grove Church was renamed Cropper Christian Church. In 1905, a bank was opened by Ben Allen Thomas, but it was closed in 1921. An 1882 map shows the first school in Cropper which was a large two-story building with grades one through twelve. It burned in 1951 and was replaced with a one-story elementary school. The team mascot was the Yellow Jackets.

He came to <link wikipedia="Illinois" osm="553784069 122586" type="node relation">Illinois</link> in 1855, settling first at <link wikipedia="Morton,_Illinois" osm="153778873 124791" type="node relation">Morton</link> in <link wikipedia="Tazewell_County,_Illinois" osm="1800585" type="relation">Tazewell County</link>. In 1867 he purchased land in Belle Prairie Township, <link wikipedia="Livingston_County,_Illinois" osm="1800376" type="relation">Livingston County</link>, just north of Cropsey. In 1882 he began buying tile to drain his farmland and then decided to manufacture his own tile in Cropsey. In 1883 he built a large house on the west side of the town of Cropsey.[3] Terpening, whose name was sometimes spelled, Henry L. Terpenning, was a native of <link wikipedia="New_York_(state)" osm="316976734 61320" type="node relation">New York</link> who had been a farmer in Cropsey Township. He was a justice of the peace and represented McLean County in the Illinois State Legislature in the 36th and 37th general assemblies during the early 1890s. About 1892 he moved to <link wikipedia="Vermilion_County,_Illinois" osm="1801537" type="relation">Vermilion County</link>. Before the town of Cropsey was established, there had been several efforts to attract a railroad to Cropsey Township. In October 1869 the township had voted $60,000 in bonds, with an additional $15,000 to be added if a station was established in the township. The money was to have helped finance the Decatur and East St. Louis Railroad. This effort failed. This railroad passed north of the township. A second chance came in 1880 with the Clinton, Bloomington and Northeastern Railroad. A number of local people donated money and land to attract the railroad to Cropsey Township. The town of Cropsey was laid out at the same time as other new towns on this railroad including <link wikipedia="Anchor,_Illinois" osm="153654981 126800" type="node relation">Anchor</link>, <link wikipedia="Colfax,_Illinois" osm="153452889 126791" type="node relation">Colfax</link>, and <link wikipedia="Cooksville,_Illinois" osm="153517980 126790" type="node relation">Cooksville</link>.
