semi metalled track, turn left and continue to follow 
the edge of the woodland. After about 1 km, C (GR 
219 421) follow the path, right back into the wood, 
down a narrow track. At D (GR 222 420) take the left 
fork and follow the path southwestwards. When you 
reach the edge of the wood, follow the waymarkers, 
directing you back to the carpark A (GR 213 409).

The canal's main cargo was coal, and it was relatively successful until the arrival of the railways in 1840. It gradually declined, with the gangway closing in 1908 and the Little Eaton Branch in 1935. Early attempts at restoration were thwarted by the closure of the whole canal in 1964. Since 1994, there has been an active campaign for restoration spearheaded by the <link wikipedia="Derby_and_Sandiacre_Canal_Trust" osm="111675767" type="way">Derby and Sandiacre Canal Trust</link> and Society. Loss of the Derwent crossing due to development has resulted in an innovative engineering solution called the Derby Arm being proposed, as a way of transferring boats across the river.

The bridge and approaches are designated but not signed as Connecticut Route 712. 
The current bridge (number 01659) was built in 1918 [3] by the Connecticut State Highway Department to replace a former steel-arch bridge built in 1891 known as the Huntington Bridge. Prior to that, an even older wooden covered bridge (built in 1857) was at this site. The Derby–Shelton Bridge used to carry two street railway tracks until the 1930s.

The Medieval commune that rose from these ruins had its own charter in the 13th century and was governed from its own Palazzo of the Consuls, but in fact Deruta has been under the dominion of neighboring <link wikipedia="Perugia" osm="68507505 42278" type="node relation">Perugia</link> since the 11th century, and has largely participated in Perugia's vicissitudes. The town's fortifications date from the 12th century, when it was an outpost in Perugia's marches, facing the rival town of <link wikipedia="Todi" osm="68507649 42137" type="node relation">Todi</link>. In 1465, under a new agreement with Perugia, the magistrate sent from Perugia would govern with the consent of four local men of good character (quattro boni omini). The ravages of plague were so fierce at Deruta that rewalling in the later 15th century took in a smaller circuit to accommodate the reduced population. Besieged in 1408 during the confusion of the Papal Schism by the condottiere Braccio da Montone, and later heavily damaged by Cesare Borgia, Deruta was plundered by Braccio Baglioni, the master of Perugia. Thus in 1540, when the Papal forces of Pope Paul III ousted the Baglioni family from Perugia in the brief war over salt taxes locally called the "Salt War" (Guerra del Sale), Deruta sided with the papacy against Perugia, an alliance that gained it a reduction in taxes. With the papal reduction of Perugia, the region settled down to uneventful history as part of the Papal States.

As river shipping declined, Des Arc was bypassed by railroads, Interstate highways, and much of the post-industrial society. Des Arc's history is preserved by seven listings on the National Register of Historic Places, and the region's history is interpreted at Lower White River State Park. The city's population stopped growing in the 1980s and has been declining since, with a population of 1,717 at the 2010 Census.

The course is located in the Sonoran desert at an elevation of about 2400–3000 feet. Very little earth was moved in the creation of the course, resulting in narrow, rolling fairways that follow the natural terrain.[4] It is considered to be the first course in the western deserts to incorporate the desert itself into the course design, instead of imposing eastern designs onto the desert landscape.[5] According to Scott Gummer of Links Magazine, "Beyond the boundary markers [the designer] staked, nothing was to be touched. Everything was—and remains today—in play, from the saguaro, ocotillo, <link wikipedia="Opuntia" osm="606585290" type="way">prickly pear</link> and myriad other varieties of cactus to the <link wikipedia="Peccary" osm="517641755" type="way">javelinas</link>, coyotes, roadrunners and rattlesnakes that call the desert home."[1]

The four-story structure, completed in 1932, was designed by American architect Mary Colter, an employee of the Fred Harvey Company who also created and designed many other buildings in the Grand Canyon vicinity including Hermit's Rest and the <link wikipedia="Lookout_Studio" osm="164580569" type="way">Lookout Studio</link>. The interior contains murals by Fred Kabotie.[3]

      <p id="GL141_452_002" num_links="2">The watchtower was the last of the series of Mary Colter-designed visitor concession structures at the Grand Canyon until her renovation of the <link wikipedia="Bright_Angel_Lodge" osm="164580572 164580573 230997058" type="way way way">Bright Angel Lodge</link> in 1935. The tower was designed to resemble an Ancestral Puebloan watchtower, but its size dwarfs any known Pueblan-built tower. The closest prototypes for such a structure may be found at <link wikipedia="Hovenweep_National_Monument" osm="2861139 5918473 5918474 5918475 5918476 5918477" type="relation relation relation relation relation relation">Hovenweep National Monument</link>. The structure is composed of a circular coursed masonry tower rising from a rubble base. The base was intentionally designed to convey a partly ruinous appearance, perhaps of an older structure on which the watchtower was later built. The base is arranged within a large circle with the tower to the north. Tiny windows are irregularly disposed, some of which are themselves irregular in shape. The main space is the Kiva Room in the base structure, apparently roofed with logs that were salvaged from the old Grandview Hotel.  The ceiling is a false structure concealing the roof structure that supports an observation deck. The Kiva Room features a fireplace with a large picture window directly above where the chimney would ordinarily go.  Smoke is drawn away through an offset, concealed flue. The room still contains its original furnishings, which are part of the historic designation.[4] A separate, apparently ruinous structure was actually built in that form to provide a storage place for firewood.[5]

Desloge developed one of his claims just north of Bonne Terre and built a concentrating plant there. After the plant was destroyed by fire in 1883, Desloge explored his properties in the present area of Desloge and consolidated several local mining companies which became known as the Desloge Consolidated Lead Company. In 1887, the land was cleared and company houses for his staff were constructed in an area referred to as "Desloge Town", just west of the present-day railroad tracks. Here, Desloge sank a shaft and built a concentrating plant which began operations in 1892. Desloge Missouri and the regional Southeast Missouri Lead Mining District became one of the principal lead mining centers in the US.[7] In 1929, the family sold the Desloge Consolidated Lead Company to the St. Joe Lead Company.[8][9][10]
