      <p id="GL142_003_002" num_links="2">The town of Despatch is situated on rich clay soil and in the late 1800s was the site of a flourishing brick industry. Despatch's name derives from this brick industry history on the account that bricks were dispatched from the original railway siding. Many of the older buildings in <link wikipedia="Uitenhage" osm="946025154" type="node">Uitenhage</link> and <link wikipedia="Port_Elizabeth" osm="25470100" type="node">Port Elizabeth</link> were built from these bricks. Most of these early bricks can be identified by the word 'Despatch' imprinted on the top and bottom of the brick. The only reminder of the town's brick industry past is a chimney built in 1882 which formed part of the Brick Works. The Chimney is situated in a field on the outskirts of the town to the north next to the railway tracks. In recent years restoration work has brought it back to its former glory including supports which now give it the appearance of a space rocket.

The park was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, beginning in 1933. Devil's Den State Park is in the Lee Creek Valley in the Boston Mountains, which are the southwestern part of The Ozarks. The park, with an 8 acres (3.2 ha) CCC-built lake, is open for year-round recreation, with trails for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. Devil's Den State Park also has several picnic areas, a swimming pool and cabins, with camping sites ranging from modern to primitive. Fossils of coral and crinoids can be found along the banks and within Lee Creek at Devil's Den State Park.[3]

With the onset of the war, the rocky area was used by bands of Confederate guerillas as a hideout and staging area for conducting raids on the Union Army's supply lines as well as civilian targets.[4] The roads of the Butterfield State Line were also used by regular troops during the Civil War. Confederate and Union forces used the road during the Battle of Prairie Grove and for the Raid on <link wikipedia="Van_Buren,_Arkansas" osm="6700055" type="relation">Van Buren</link>.[4] The former town of Anna is contained within the park. It was destroyed by a flood in 1893. All that remains of the town is a cemetery, a well, and some foundations. The remnants of Anna can be seen along the Butterfield Hiking Trail near Junction Camp.[5]

Also known locally as Kotada timba, the site contains ruins of an ancient Indus Valley Civilization/Harappan city.[1] Dholavira’s location is on the Tropic of Cancer. It is one of the five largest Harappan sites[2] and most prominent archaeological sites in India belonging to the Indus Valley Civilization.[3] It is also considered as having been the grandest of cities[4]  of its time. It is located on Khadir bet island in the <link wikipedia="Kutch_Desert_Wildlife_Sanctuary" osm="669220103" type="way">Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary</link> in the Great Rann of Kutch. The 47 ha (120 acres) quadrangular city lay between two seasonal streams, the Mansar in the north and Manhar in the south.[5] The site was occupied from c.2650 BCE, declining slowly after about 2100 BCE. It was briefly abandoned then reoccupied until c.1450 BCE.[6]

Due to the nature of the tramway's construction, the cars can stop and drop off almost anywhere and will do so within reason.

The crossings/halts usually take the name of the farmer or the farm as is the case here, but these unofficial halts never appear in timetable materials or have nameboards fitted to show their names.  Many do however now carry bus stop-type signs attached to traction poles, and these were fitted in line with then-management policy in 1999.

For this reason there is a concrete-built docking area built especially for the locomotive to take on coal and water, which has more recently been used as a loading area for flatbed wagons on the line.  In addition to the two usual running lines (a crossover is also located at this point) there are several sidings, a fraction of what was once here, and these were used solely in connection with quarry traffic.  A collection of buildings were also extant, including the "Creosote Cottage" and the body off a 10-12 class tramcar used as a storeroom for many years.  By the time of the 1993 events the area had been tidied up, portaloos installed and many of the old building disappeared.  The stone-built cottage remains in situ however and is used in connection with permanent way duties.  From a passing tram today, there are always items of interest here, it is where the 0-6-0 diesel locomotive "Bertie" is usually stored together with a stockpile of replacement sleepers.
