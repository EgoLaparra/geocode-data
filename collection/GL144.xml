In her 2000 visit, Flintan found that the commercial and retail activities of Dinso consisted largely of houses, shops, ‘hotels’ and tea houses.
She found the shops were "poorly stocked with few tinned and some dried goods such as spaghetti and
plain biscuits." The principal tourism services was the Wolf’s Den Café which offers trekking facilities including the hiring of guides and horses.[1]

The regional capital is the city of <link wikipedia="Diourbel" osm="249742121" type="node">Diourbel</link>.  The region corresponds roughly to the precolonial Kingdom of Bawol and is still called by that name. Bawol (or Baol) is an ancient kingdom formerly ruled by the Joof family, one of the members of the Serer ethnic group found in Senegambia.[2][3] Inhabitants of the area are called Bawol-Bawol which takes its name from the Serer mode of pluralisation, other examples being : Sine-Sine or Siin-Siin (inhabitants of Sine), Saloum-Saloum (inhabitants of <link wikipedia="Saloum" osm="331190525" type="way">Saloum</link>), etc. The population is primarily comprised by the Serer people especially those from the Cangin group, the Safene in particular.[4][5][6] The Serers are believed to be the original inhabitants of this area.[4] The Wolof and other ethnic groups are also present. The Diourbel Region is rich in history and it is where the Cekeen Tumulus are located.  Some scholars such as Charles Becker, Henry Gravrand, Victor Martin among others, suggests that, these monuments were built by the Serer people[7][8] and form part of the Serer tumulus of Baol[7] (see also <link wikipedia="Senegambian_stone_circles" osm="1170998815 7314927" type="node relation">Senegambian stone circles</link>). They are some of the most sacred sites in Serer religion. The Département of Mbacke also includes Murid Islamic Sufi order's holy city of <link wikipedia="Touba" osm="293437934" type="node">Touba</link>. The installation of this order in Serer country[4] is a controversial one, especially among those Serers who adhere to the tenets of Serer religion (see Serer history (medieval era to present).[4] However, some Serers are also Muslims and have headed this religious order.[4]

It is about 80 kilometres (50 miles) long and between 3 and 15 kilometres (1.9 and 9.3 miles) wide and is Western Australia's largest and most western island.  It covers an area of 620 square kilometres (240 square miles) and is approximately 850 kilometres (530 miles) north of <link wikipedia="Perth" osm="29277817" type="node">Perth</link>. It was named after Dirk Hartog, a Dutch sea captain, who first encountered the Western Australian coastline close to the 26th parallel south latitude, which runs through the island. After leaving the island, Hartog continued his voyage north-east along the mainland coast. Hartog gave the Australian mainland one of its earliest known names, as Eendrachtsland, which he named after his ship Eendracht, meaning "concord".

The federal government's expanded role nationally and internationally beginning in the 1930s raised new issues for senatorial action, which in turn required increased staff assistance and created crowded conditions in the Capitol and the original Senate Office Building.  When World War II delayed implementation of the Senate's building plans, the space problems grew increasingly urgent.  Soon after the war, the United States Congress passed the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, in order to modernize and streamline its operations and provide senators and committees with professional staff assistance.  To house the additional staff, the Senate resorted to renting space in nearby buildings.  Moreover, with the anticipated admission of <link wikipedia="Alaska" osm="474582475 1116270" type="node relation">Alaska</link> and <link wikipedia="Hawaii" osm="316949921 166563" type="node relation">Hawaii</link> as states, four new senators would also require office space.

In 1665, William Drummond, future governor of North Carolina, was the first European to explore the lake which now bears his name. William Byrd II led a surveying party into the swamp to draw a dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina in 1728. George Washington visited the swamp and called it a "glorious paradise".[7] He then formed the Dismal Swamp Land Company in 1763, which proceeded to drain and harvest timber from part of the area. A five-mile (8 km) ditch on the west side of the current refuge still bears his name. In 1805, the <link wikipedia="Dismal_Swamp_Canal" osm="163752588" type="way">Dismal Swamp Canal</link> began serving as a commercial highway for timber coming out of the swamp.[8]

A congregation of General Baptists began to meet in the 17th century in the village, which was a local centre for Protestant Nonconformist worship, and by the time the present simple Vernacular-style chapel was constructed in 1740 a large proportion of the population held Baptist beliefs.  Along with other General Baptist chapels in Sussex, the congregation moved towards Unitarian views in the mid-18th century; this caused a schism which resulted in a new chapel being formed at nearby <link wikipedia="Wivelsfield" osm="2781557" type="relation">Wivelsfield</link>.  The character of the Ditchling chapel was wholly Unitarian by 1800, and it has continued under various names since then.  People associated with the chapel include William Hale White (the author "Mark Rutherford"),[1] Henry Acton, Adrian Boult—who was married there—and G. K. Chesterton.[2]  The chapel is set back from Ditchling's main street and has an adjoining house (built in 1672) and graveyard, all of which contribute to the character of the conservation area which covers the centre of Ditchling village.  English Heritage has listed the chapel at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance.

Owing to Turkish raids, the monastery was deserted in the 17th century; at the beginning of the 18th century, Dipša was mentioned as an appendage of the neighbouring Kuveždin monastery. Its old church underwent reconstruction in 1744, but the final alteration was made in 1762, when a new narthex was built. A chapel dedicated to the Mother of God was placed therein, upstairs.The iconostasis for the restored church was carried out by Teodor Stefanov Gologlavac in 1753.
