The site, which lies in the middle of the countryside, has been protected from the encroachment of modern urbanization, in contrast, for example, to Carthage, which has been pillaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions. Dougga's size, its well-preserved monuments and its rich Numidian-Berber, Punic, ancient Roman and Byzantine history make it exceptional. Amongst the most famous monuments at the site are a Libyco-Punic Mausoleum, the capitol, the theater, and the temples of Saturn and of Juno Caelestis.

Much of the parkland currently surrounding Fort Calgary was industrial as recently as the 1960s.[3] Construction of the city's light rail transit Blue Line, coupled with the closure of 8th Avenue at Macleod Trail in the early 1980s by construction of the massive Calgary Municipal Building, resulted in East Village being "cut off," figuratively speaking, from the rest of downtown.[4]  As a result, it became home to many rundown properties and vacant lots over the years, and a severe crime problem.[4]

The downtown developed as a linear area just north of the main port area, Main Street forming an east-west axis.  The oldest surviving commercial building dates to 1742, and the oldest house to 1745.  A major fire in the downtown in 1793 encouraged a shift to brick construction, but growth was squelched by the economic blockades associated with the War of 1812.  The downtown's architecture is consequently dominated by Greek Revival andlate 19th and early 20th century architecture, which was built when the city was an important point for the transshipment of goods by either rail or ship.  By this time, the city's economy had diversified to include banking, textiles, and other water-powered industry.[2]  The downtown area includes many intact 18th and 19th-century buildings centered on the now-picturesque harbor.[3]

With the arrival of railroads in the 1830s, the city became a major transit point for freight moved on railroads along similar routes.  Its early train stations were located at the northern end of downtown, on the west side of Main Street near the main rail junction.  A major former freight house, built in 1875, is located north of the tracks and east of Main Street.  In 1889 the grade-level crossing of Main Street was replaced by a stone arch bridge; it and the stone embankment wall on the north side of Lyman Street were designed by H. H. Richardson.  This change was accompanied by the construction of new stations on the east side of Main Street, which were consolidated into a single large <link wikipedia="Springfield_Union_Station_(Massachusetts)" osm="367781363 118851040" type="node way">Union Station</link> in 1924.
