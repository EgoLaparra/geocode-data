A new pair of sails were fitted in 1923 at a cost of ƒ565.[3] The sails were fitted with Dekker streamlined leading edges in 1937 by millwright Westra of <link wikipedia="Franeker" osm="235270746 385297" type="node relation">Franeker</link>. A diesel engine was installed as auxiliary power in 1961 and the Archimedes' screw was renewed. The mill ceased working a few years later. The mill was restored in 1975. Common sails were fitted as part of the restoration.[2] The mill was sold to Stichting De Fryske Mole (English: Frisian Mills Foundation) in 1977.[4] New sails were fitted in 2008.[1]

</p>
      <p id="GL150_182_002" num_links="2">The history of De Gekroonde Poelenburg is rather complicated involving several distinct windmills. The first windmill on the original location of the first De Poelenburg in Zaandam-Oost was mentioned in 1733. It was named after its owner Pieter Jochemsz. Poelenburg. This mill burned down in 1903 and was replaced by a windmill from <link wikipedia="Koog_aan_de_Zaan" osm="337727" type="relation">Koog aan de Zaan</link> called De Locomotief (The Locomotive) which was renamed to De Gekroonde Poelenburg after the move. De Locomotief was newly built in Koog aan de Zaan in 1867 to replace the 200-year-old De Groene Jager (The Green Hunter) that had to be dismantled for the construction of a railway line by the HSM. Hence the name of the new mill. De Gekroonde Poelenburg, formerly De Locomotief, was working until 1950 after which it fell into disrepair. It was acquired by Vereniging De Zaansche Molen and moved to the <link wikipedia="Zaanse_Schans" osm="177095326" type="way">Zaanse Schans</link> in 1963. It was re-erected at the site of pealing windmill De Grootvorst that had burned down in 1928. The restored mill turned out to be very hard to wind and attempts to use this mill commercially were abandoned in 1966. Since then it is operated by volunteers. The winding problem was solved years later. In hindsight a misunderstanding on the weight distribution of paltrok mills may have caused the problem. It is now known that most of the weight should be carried by the central post and not evenly divided between post and roller ring (see below). Another misunderstanding was put right in 2005 when the black tar coating of 1963 was replaced by the original bright green paint.[2]

      <p id="GL150_291_002" num_links="2">De Otter, probably earlier known as De Kleine Otter (The Small <link wikipedia="Otter" osm="147147086" type="way">Otter</link>) was built in or shortly after 1631. It is the only one left over from a group of sawmills built in the area between the Kostverlorenvaart canal and the Singelgracht. Gerrit van der Beyl bought the mill in 1817. The firm Van der Beyl expanded their property by acquiring several neighboring sawmills. City expansion started to threaten the mills by the end of the 19th century and during several decades the mills were one by one dismantled. De Otter was probably in production until the start of the 20th century. In 1925 the sails were removed after the wooden windshaft was torn but the rest of the mill remained standing. The last operational wind powered sawmill, De Eenhoorn (The Unicorn), located north of De Otter, shut down in 1929 and was dismantled in 1931, leaving De Otter as the only remainder of this local industry. De Otter was placed on the list of monuments in 1977. The mill was restored to working order after a two-year restoration project started in 1994 after which it was regularly running. However the location of the mill for catching the wind was already difficult in the buildup area of Amsterdam and it got worse by the construction of large apartment buildings close to the windmill. Stichting Houtzaagmolen De Otter, as owner of the mill, therefor proposed to move the mill to <link wikipedia="Uitgeest" osm="46874557 290108 290111" type="node relation relation">Uitgeest</link>. However the local government had to give permission to move a Rijksmonument and it turned out the local city council was strongly opposed to this idea. The fierce discussion became the subject of several court cases between 2006 and 2011. For the time being De Otter is still in its original location but not being operated.[1][2]

As from the 13th century, there was in the east of the current village center, a mining farm located, in which activities started from the 18th century with a systematic exploration. On the Ferrari-map from the 1770s, the place appears as a rural area with scattered hamlets and country estates. In the place of the current center, the map still shows the hamlet Pintestraete.

      <p id="GL150_316_001" num_links="2">The first paper mill in the Zaan region was built in 1605.[3] De Schoolmeester was built in 1692.[1] It is also known by the nickname De Gauwdief.[4] The name De Schoolmeester (English: The Schoolmaster) probably denotes the occupation of one of the founders. The mill originally made grey paper. In 1778, the mill was powering two Hollander beaters. In 1852, the mill was bought by Gerbrand de Jong, who owned another wind-powered paper mill, De Kaarsenmaker at <link wikipedia="Zaandijk" osm="337726" type="relation">Zaandijk</link>. He bought another nearby paper mill, De Vergulde Bijenkorf in 1854. In 1871, the mills were owned by Gebroeders de Jong, who demolished De Kaarsenmaker in the autumn of 1873. In 1877, the mill was modernised and a steam engine installed as auxiliary power. This meant that the mill was uninsureable against fire. In 1902, the nearby De Vergulde Bijenkorf burnt down. A steam driven paper factory was erected to replace it. This factory was able to make white paper. A fire started at De Schoolmeester in 1915 but was extinguished.[5] In 1948, the steam engine was replaced by a <link wikipedia="Ford_Motor_Company" osm="170973946 232375504" type="way way">Ford</link> gas engine. On 1 March 1949, the drying sheds were damaged in a storm, with over 30 metres (98 ft) of them being affected. They were rebuilt shorter than they had been previously.[4] On 28 August 1957, De Schoolmeester was sold to Vereniging van Nederlandsche Papierfabrikanten by the de Jongs.[5] In 1964, the gas engine was replaced by a Bernard diesel engine.[4] In 1977, the mill was bought by Vereniging Zaansche Molens.[3] The diesel engine was replaced by an electric motor in 1979.[4] A four-year restoration of the mill at a cost of €450,000 was completed in June 2002. The work included complete renewal of the drying sheds.[3]

Later in the 19th century, many cultures of Native Americans arrived in the area after being pushed west by European-American pressure following colonial expansion and later the discovery of Gold in 1849. Between 1829-1854 almost thirty tribes were assigned reservations in what would become Kansas Territory. The Shawnee Methodist Mission was built in the De Soto area to minister to the tribe.[7] A reserve was established in Kansas and soon other Shawnee from as far east as Ohio would join the reservation. The Agency of the Shawnee Indians, also known as Lexington, was located on the southern edge of the city.[7]

During <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>, the mill was used to send signals to the Dutch resistance. This was done by the position that the sails were set at. In 1965, Baroness van Verschuer left the mill to her brother's children. This brought the mill under the ownership of the abbey again. The mill was restored in 1968-69, gaining its name at this time. The mill has been worked regularly since 2009. It is listed as a Rijksmonument, № 16467.[1]

There is also a wear line on the brickwork where a roller once supported the tail construction. The current internal winding winches resemble those fitted in windmills in <link wikipedia="North_Holland" osm="4289948988 47654" type="node relation">Noord-Holland</link> and not those in the older tower mills of Zeddam and <link wikipedia="De_Buitenmolen,_Zevenaar" osm="271334134" type="way">Zevenaar</link>.[1]
