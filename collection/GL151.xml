On February 14 1856, the thirty-first General Assembly of the state of Tennessee incorporated the town of Decherd with all the rights and privileges as the town of Cookeville, which was also incorporated at that time.[4] After the Civil War, Decherd was again incorporated as a town on January 30, 1868. It was unincorporated in 1885 to avoid application of the "Four Mile Law", which permitted liquor sales within four miles of schools located in incorporated communities. The town was chartered once again by the General Assembly on April 22, 1901.[5]
The Haynes House in Decherd is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The area around Dedemsvaart, until 2001 part of the municipality of Avereest, was an important center for industry.

High levels of mercury had been detected in the lake and efforts have been made to reduce the amount of mercury going into the lake. As a result of contamination, Deer Lake was designated as a catch and release site, as fish caught in the lake were unsafe for consumption.[2]
In late 2014, the lake was delisted as an AOC, one of the first two lakes to be delisted in the state and one of only three AOCs to achieve the status.[3] According to the EPA, the restrictions on fishing were removed as well.[4]

      <p id="GL151_371_001" num_links="6">Del Norte is named from the river Rio Grande del Norte, or "large river of the north".[9]  The Utes were the first-known people to live here, particularly in the summers because of the abundance of wild game, plants, water, and timber in the area.  However, winters were often too cold and harsh for them to settle permanently.  Spanish and Mexican peoples were the first non-Natives to explore the nearby land, coming from <link wikipedia="Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico" osm="151741916 171264" type="node relation">Santa Fe</link> and other parts of New Mexico.  They were interested in surveying the 'Rio del Norte' or 'River of the North', hence the origin of the town's name.  This was the original name of the Rio Grande headwaters prior to numerous name changes over the years.  Under Mexican jurisdiction, Hispanic families began moving into the area during the early to mid-19th century as part of land grants to help the Mexican government fill and occupy the territory.  However, no large-scale settlements could be established because the Utes were very weary of Euro-American settlement, and would chase off many people who attempted to do so.  The most successful early settlement nearby was called 'La Loma', established a few miles east of where the current town site is today.  This area was chosen because there was a particular section of the Rio Grande here where it could be crossed safely and easily - one of few known for miles during this time.  American settlement began in the early 1870s by prospectors who were searching the nearby mountains for minerals such as gold and silver, particularly near an eventual boom-town named Summitville, located at the base of South Mountain near Bennett Peak.  These peaks in the San Juan Mountains were some of the last parts of Colorado where miners were allowed to explore and prospect for minerals, and they were finally able to do so after the Brunot Treaty was signed between the U.S. government and the Utes in 1873.  Once the mines proved profitable, Del Norte was officially established around 1874 in order to serve as a base camp for the mines not just in Summitville, but also in nearby <link wikipedia="Creede,_Colorado" osm="5505245" type="relation">Creede</link> and <link wikipedia="Lake_City,_Colorado" osm="6915189" type="relation">Lake City</link>.  Miners quickly moved into the area, and they were followed by ranchers and farmers.  Many of these original farming and ranching families still have operations and live in the Del Norte area to this day.  After the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, mining operations quickly became unprofitable and ceased.  The 'glory days' of Del Norte ended as quickly as they began, but the community still survived because of ranching and agriculture.[10]  There were talks across southern Colorado throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s to secede from the state of Colorado and create the state of San Juan, with Del Norte acting as this proposed state's capital city, however this secession movement died quickly.  Del Norte would see cycles of boom and bust throughout the 20th century, but has recently become a blossoming community due to the abundance of recreational activities provided by the area's unique geography; such as mountain biking, hiking, rock climbing, fishing, hunting, rafting and kayaking, camping, etc.  Del Norte is also one of the communities which provides lodging for nearby Wolf Creek Ski Area.  Grande Avenue, the main street through Del Norte, still has many of the facades on its store fronts from the 1800s and early 1900s, reminding its residents and tourists of the town's historic past.  In 2019, the <link wikipedia="Rio_Grande_National_Forest" osm="396319" type="relation">Rio Grande National Forest</link> announced that it will be moving its headquarters from nearby <link wikipedia="Monte_Vista,_Colorado" osm="113259" type="relation">Monte Vista</link> to Del Norte, and the town announced that it will be improving its riverwalk to include a <link wikipedia="Rafting" osm="4378756794" type="node">white-water park</link> along the Rio Grande.
