      <p id="GL152_199_002" num_links="2">The Duke Homestead was built about 1852 by Washington Duke, on a farm that was about 300 acres (120 ha) in size when the American Civil War broke out.  During the war, the property was, like many others, looted by Union Army.  With little left beyond a small supply of tobacco, the family shifted from tobacco farming to tobacco processing, introducing cigarettes in 1881 to compete with loose-leaf tobacco.  This property is where the Dukes did their early tobacco processing, eventually moving into downtown Durham in 1874.  The Duke business was incorporated as the American Tobacco Company in 1890, and was the largest tobacco company in the world until an antitrust suit broke it up in 1911. In 1931, the farm was purchased by <link wikipedia="Duke_University" osm="7407432" type="relation">Duke University</link>, and in 1966, the Duke Homestead was designated a National Historic Landmark by the <link wikipedia="National_Park_Service" osm="293087669" type="way">National Park Service</link>.

A 1908 Lighthouse Board report, in recommending construction of a light on the north pier, noted that a private aid was already being placed on the pier.[2][4][5]  Appropriation was made in 1909, and a tower was erected and lit the following year.[4] The design was based off that of the <link wikipedia="Peche_Island_Rear_Range_Light" osm="466471322" type="way">Peche Island Rear Range Light</link>, featuring a short round tower built of steel plates.[5] A fifth-order Fresnel lens from France was installed and lit with a 210-candlepower electric lamp powered from the city power grid.[5] All the lights on the canal were maintained by the same keepers; the head keeper lived in a frame house constructed in 1874 with the <link wikipedia="Duluth_South_Breakwater_Outer_Light" osm="470132523" type="node">Duluth South Breakwater Outer Light</link>, while the assistants were given a brick duplex in 1913 after years of having to find boarding accommodations on their own.[4]

The name derived from plans to build a bridge across the Willamette River for the railroad, which would have called for a junction at Dundee between the west railroad and the new east railroad.
