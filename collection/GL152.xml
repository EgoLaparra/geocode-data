HUSS Park Attractions (previously known as Huss Maschinenfabrik) spent most of its existence since the late 1970s creating small and mid-size flat rides for traveling carnivals and small amusement parks.  As the company evolved taking on more challenging projects, they quickly discovered a growing market for unique flat ride designs that were affordable and could be easily marketed.  The rides grew in size and accommodated larger capacities over time attracting major amusement parks around the world.

It was originally named Dalles Spring, from a French word referring to water, but railroad personnel later shortened the name for telegraphic efficiency.[3] It possessed a water tower, a reservoir, and numerous homes where railroad employees and their families resided from at least 1920 until 1940. The inhabitants were primarily Irish, Scot and Greek immigrants. Water was obtained from springs located as far as 12 miles (19 km) away in nearby mountains (Delle Ranch located along the east bench of Skull Valley being the primary) and piped to the site. After diesel powered engines were introduced, Delle continued as a site station for railroad employees in charge of track upkeep between <link wikipedia="Wendover,_Utah" osm="150955294 198968" type="node relation">Wendover</link>, Utah and <link wikipedia="Salt_Lake_City" osm="150935219 198770" type="node relation">Salt Lake City</link>.

      <p id="GL152_166_002" num_links="2">The area was a part of the Majapahit Empire during its zenith around the 14th century. The <link wikipedia="Demak,_Demak" osm="262265672" type="node">city</link> itself was founded sometime in the late fifteenth century, possibly by a Chinese whose descendant later became the Sultans of Demak. The first Sultan was known as Raden Patah, who was a vassal of Majapahit until 1478.[3] The city was founded as a seaport, next to the now-nonexistent Muria Palaeostrait separating Java from Muria Island (now Mount Muria), although silting has now entirely turned the waterway into land.[4] The Sultanate expanded in the expense of the declining Majapahit and its fragments, conquering the coastal region of Tuban around 1527 and reaching inland areas as far as <link wikipedia="Malang" osm="2518173352 9674151" type="node relation">Malang</link> by 1546.[3] As the capital, the city became an important center for trade and the spread of Islam across the island, and a base of the semi-apocryphal Wali Sanga. Upon the decline of the Sultanate, the region was conquered in turn by the Pajang and Mataram Sultanates.[5] The seaport began to silt sometime in the 17th century, diminishing the region's importance as a seaport.

Construction assistance was provided by the British Government, but the basic design was by a Guyanese, Capt. John Patrick Coghlan. The bridge was only designed to last 10 years, yet it is still going strong.[1][2] Tolls are collected only in one direction of travel even though the bridge handles one lane of traffic in each direction. Traffic going west to east pays no toll.

The Demerara's estuary is narrow and the flowrate is rapid. This scouring action maintains a 5-to-6-metre-deep direct channel to the ocean. The river's deep brown color is primarily the result of the massive quantities of silt carried from upriver by the powerful currents. So powerful are these currents, that the ocean retains the Demerara's brown color for a considerable distance out to sea.

      <p id="GL152_232_002" num_links="2">Demyansk was first mentioned in a chronicle in 1406 as Demon. The area was a part of Derevskaya Pyatina of <link wikipedia="Veliky_Novgorod" osm="27017589 2417529 3396084" type="node relation relation">Novgorod</link>.[2] Demon was a fortress protecting a waterway from Lake Ilmen upstream the Pola and the Yavon to Lake Seliger. The fortress was located close to the boundary between the Novgorod Republic and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and it was at least twice sieged by Muscovite troops. In 1441, the Muscovites did not manage to conquer Demon, but in the 1470s they conquered and destroyed the fortress. After the subsequent fall of Novgorod, Demon was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In the 17th century, Demon went into decline, and a new settlement was founded nearby, which was known as Demyansky Pogost, and later as Demyansk. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by <link wikipedia="Peter_the_Great" osm="6204100696" type="node">Peter the Great</link>, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. Between 1772 and 1824, Demyansk was a part of Starorussky Uyezd of Novgorod Viceroyalty (since 1796 of Novgorod Governorate). In 1824, it was chartered and became the center of Demyansky Uyezd, which was split off Starorussky Uyezd.[11]

Between 1891 and 1946, the village's Turkish Cypriot population did not increase, whilst the Greek Cypriot population continually increased. In 1960, Greek Cypriots constituted 61.5% of the population of 324 people (196 Greek Cypriots, 128 Turkish Cypriots).

Turkish Cypriot inhabitants were relocated to Şirinevler (Agios Ermolaos), where they were given land. Today, the original Greek Cypriot inhabitants live in the village, while the Turkish Cypriot quarter lies in ruins.[2]

Walker and Hollis Tucker, land speculators, laid out lots for a new town, which was named after Tucker's hometown, Denison, Ohio.  Most of the houses and two churches in Tippinville were bodily moved to the new townsite, which is primarily in Garfield Township, with a small portion in Cedar Township (it was all Cedar Township at first).  By August 1890, Tippinvile had been officially vacated and by 1894 Denison had a population of 150.

Walk description
This walk was developed in conjunction with White Cliffs Countryside Project. Follow the Reinden Wood finger posts along the route. From the car park A (GR 213 409), follow the bridleway northwards to the edge of the wood B (GR 214 413). On meeting a gravelly/
semi metalled track, turn left and continue to follow 
the edge of the woodland. After about 1 km, C (GR 
219 421) follow the path, right back into the wood, 
down a narrow track. At D (GR 222 420) take the left 
fork and follow the path southwestwards. When you 
reach the edge of the wood, follow the waymarkers, 
directing you back to the carpark A (GR 213 409).
