The Medieval commune that rose from these ruins had its own charter in the 13th century and was governed from its own Palazzo of the Consuls, but in fact Deruta has been under the dominion of neighboring <link wikipedia="Perugia" osm="68507505 42278" type="node relation">Perugia</link> since the 11th century, and has largely participated in Perugia's vicissitudes. The town's fortifications date from the 12th century, when it was an outpost in Perugia's marches, facing the rival town of <link wikipedia="Todi" osm="68507649 42137" type="node relation">Todi</link>. In 1465, under a new agreement with Perugia, the magistrate sent from Perugia would govern with the consent of four local men of good character (quattro boni omini). The ravages of plague were so fierce at Deruta that rewalling in the later 15th century took in a smaller circuit to accommodate the reduced population. Besieged in 1408 during the confusion of the Papal Schism by the condottiere Braccio da Montone, and later heavily damaged by Cesare Borgia, Deruta was plundered by Braccio Baglioni, the master of Perugia. Thus in 1540, when the Papal forces of Pope Paul III ousted the Baglioni family from Perugia in the brief war over salt taxes locally called the "Salt War" (Guerra del Sale), Deruta sided with the papacy against Perugia, an alliance that gained it a reduction in taxes. With the papal reduction of Perugia, the region settled down to uneventful history as part of the Papal States.

As river shipping declined, Des Arc was bypassed by railroads, Interstate highways, and much of the post-industrial society. Des Arc's history is preserved by seven listings on the National Register of Historic Places, and the region's history is interpreted at Lower White River State Park.

Two dams had also been completed, but they have since been removed. Even though the project was never completed, navigation was possible via the locks as far upriver as Keosauqua.[2]

Palmer and Tom Darlington, who created the town of Carefree north of <link wikipedia="Scottsdale,_Arizona" osm="1389678" type="relation">Scottsdale</link> in the early 1950s. The course is located in the Sonoran desert at an elevation of about 2400–3000 feet. Very little earth was moved in the creation of the course, resulting in narrow, rolling fairways that follow the natural terrain.[4] It is considered to be the first course in the western deserts to incorporate the desert itself into the course design, instead of imposing eastern designs onto the desert landscape.[5] According to Scott Gummer of Links Magazine, "Beyond the boundary markers [the designer] staked, nothing was to be touched. Everything was—and remains today—in play, from the saguaro, ocotillo, <link wikipedia="Opuntia" osm="606585290" type="way">prickly pear</link> and myriad other varieties of cactus to the <link wikipedia="Peccary" osm="517641755" type="way">javelinas</link>, coyotes, roadrunners and rattlesnakes that call the desert home."[1]

The four-story structure, completed in 1932, was designed by American architect Mary Colter, an employee of the Fred Harvey Company who also created and designed many other buildings in the Grand Canyon vicinity including <link wikipedia="Hermits_Rest" osm="174994338" type="way">Hermit's Rest</link> and the <link wikipedia="Lookout_Studio" osm="164580569" type="way">Lookout Studio</link>.

The closest prototypes for such a structure may be found at <link wikipedia="Hovenweep_National_Monument" osm="2861139 5918473 5918474 5918475 5918476 5918477" type="relation relation relation relation relation relation">Hovenweep National Monument</link>. The structure is composed of a circular coursed masonry tower rising from a rubble base. The base was intentionally designed to convey a partly ruinous appearance, perhaps of an older structure on which the watchtower was later built. The base is arranged within a large circle with the tower to the north. Tiny windows are irregularly disposed, some of which are themselves irregular in shape. The main space is the Kiva Room in the base structure, apparently roofed with logs that were salvaged from the old Grandview Hotel.  The ceiling is a false structure concealing the roof structure that supports an observation deck. The Kiva Room features a fireplace with a large picture window directly above where the chimney would ordinarily go.  Smoke is drawn away through an offset, concealed flue. The room still contains its original furnishings, which are part of the historic designation.[4] A separate, apparently ruinous structure was actually built in that form to provide a storage place for firewood.[5]

Desloge developed one of his claims just north of Bonne Terre and built a concentrating plant there. After the plant was destroyed by fire in 1883, Desloge explored his properties in the present area of Desloge and consolidated several local mining companies which became known as the Desloge Consolidated Lead Company. In 1887, the land was cleared and company houses for his staff were constructed in an area referred to as "Desloge Town", just west of the present-day railroad tracks. Here, Desloge sank a shaft and built a concentrating plant which began operations in 1892. Desloge Missouri and the regional Southeast Missouri Lead Mining District became one of the principal lead mining centers in the US.[7] In 1929, the family sold the Desloge Consolidated Lead Company to the St. Joe Lead Company.[8][9][10]

However, it differs from commuter towns in that it forms part of the city proper and is not regarded as suburb in a classical sense. Still, its currently weak transportation links with the major part of the city on the Right Bank make it appear as a "city inside a city", which is especially true for Troieschyna microdistrict.[2]

It is located about three miles (five km) from GM's corporate headquarters.  When the facility opened, it was built on the original Dodge Factory [1] location that was built in 1911, which was closed in 1980 and demolished in 1981, and the new GM factory built vehicles for GM's "BOC" (Buick/Oldsmobile/Cadillac) Group.  The first vehicle, a Cadillac Eldorado, rolled off the assembly line on February 4, 1985.[2]
