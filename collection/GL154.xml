The park was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, beginning in 1933. Devil's Den State Park is in the Lee Creek Valley in the Boston Mountains, which are the southwestern part of The Ozarks. The park, with an 8 acres (3.2 ha) CCC-built lake, is open for year-round recreation, with trails for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. Devil's Den State Park also has several picnic areas, a swimming pool and cabins, with camping sites ranging from modern to primitive. Fossils of coral and crinoids can be found along the banks and within Lee Creek at Devil's Den State Park.[3]

With the onset of the war, the rocky area was used by bands of Confederate guerillas as a hideout and staging area for conducting raids on the Union Army's supply lines as well as civilian targets.[4] The roads of the Butterfield State Line were also used by regular troops during the Civil War. Confederate and Union forces used the road during the Battle of Prairie Grove and for the Raid on <link wikipedia="Van_Buren,_Arkansas" osm="6700055" type="relation">Van Buren</link>.[4] The former town of Anna is contained within the park. It was destroyed by a flood in 1893. All that remains of the town is a cemetery, a well, and some foundations. The remnants of Anna can be seen along the Butterfield Hiking Trail near Junction Camp.[5]

Municipal status was attained in 1890. Dewetsdorp was the scene of heavy fighting in the Second Anglo-Boer War. In 1927 three officials died when the town hall was blown up by one Huibrecht Jacob de Leeuw in an attempt to cover up evidence of his embezzlement of town funds.[4][5] The new Town Hall built in 1928 was declared a South African Heritage Site in 1995.[6]

In addition to the two usual running lines (a crossover is also located at this point) there are several sidings, a fraction of what was once here, and these were used solely in connection with quarry traffic.  A collection of buildings were also extant, including the "Creosote Cottage" and the body off a 10-12 class tramcar used as a storeroom for many years.  By the time of the 1993 events the area had been tidied up, portaloos installed and many of the old building disappeared.  The stone-built cottage remains in situ however and is used in connection with permanent way duties.  From a passing tram today, there are always items of interest here, it is where the 0-6-0 diesel locomotive "Bertie" is usually stored together with a stockpile of replacement sleepers.

Under the new name Diagonal Mar, in reference to its proximity to the sea and Avinguda Diagonal, renovation started taking place in the late 1990s. Still ongoing, this has been one of the most ambitions urban regeneration schemes, and also one of the most controversial and a perceived departure from Barcelona's well-established urban model. The real estate company Hines was in charge of most relevant decisions about urbanism in the area, although it was ESPAIS Promocions Immobiliaries, a local real estate developer, who developed the majority of the residential towers, including Illa de la Llum, Illa del Bosc, Illa del Cell and Illa del Mar. This has been criticised by renowned local architects such as Oriol Bohigas, Juli Capellas or Josep Maria Montaner or urbanism scholar Llàtzer Moix.[1] Most renovation in the area was ready in time for the 2004 Cultural Forum, which took place in the International Convention Centre of Barcelona (CCIB).

The purpose of the dam is to prevent saltwater intrusion upstream, supply water for the irrigation of about 45,000 ha (110,000 acres) of crops and create a road crossing for the road between St. Louis and <link wikipedia="Nouakchott" osm="249166495 3395130" type="node relation">Nouakchott</link> in Mauritania. Additionally, a ship lock built within the dam provides for navigation upstream. Plans for the dam were first drawn in 1970 when the riparian states within the Senegal River Basin Development Authority agreed to develop the Senegal River. The Diama Dam was to be constructed in conjunction with the <link wikipedia="Manantali_Dam" osm="190325901" type="way">Manantali Dam</link> which was to be located further upstream in <link wikipedia="Mali" osm="424297816 192785" type="node relation">Mali</link>. Construction on the Diama Dam began on 15 September 1981 and was completed on 12 August 1986. The Manantali Dam was completed in 1988. The Diama project was funded by a US$149.5 million loan from the <link wikipedia="African_Development_Bank" osm="3528407350" type="node">African Development Bank</link>.[1][2] The main section of the dam with ship lock and spillway is 170 m (560 ft) long while a 440 m (1,440 ft) long embankment dam section extends north to the edge of the river. A dike further extends the dam to the north. The dam is 18 m (59 ft) tall and its spillway has a maximum discharge of 6,500 m3/s (230,000 cu ft/s).[3]
