To the east of the road is the original 19th century cemetery and to the west of the road lies the 20th century addition. Today, it caters for all faiths with separate burial grounds and chapels for Jews and <link wikipedia="Catholic_Church" osm="618656792" type="way">Catholics</link> and a growing one for Muslims together with two military cemeteries. The 19th century cemetery is designed with an informal garden cemetery layout with winding paths while the remainder is a more formal grid type which was favoured by cemetery designer John Claudius Loudon. Much of the original cemetery is a County Wildlife Site and contains grassland and a wide selection of mature trees.[1]

It is located nine miles west from Angleton.  It was one of the most important inland ports in Texas.  The river port became a vital component in the plantation-based economy that developed along the Brazos River in the 19th century. The community was founded in 1824 by Josiah Hughes Bell. A native of South Carolina, Bell came to Texas with Stephen F. Austin’s Old 300 colony in 1821.  Bell built a landing of log-lines docks and timbered stops on the Brazos River just below Varner’s Creek.  Bell laid out the town and called it Marion.  Bell sold the townsite to Walter C. White in 1827.  By the mid-1800s the town had a population of 800. The arrival of the railroad in the area led to the decline of steamboat traffic which had an adverse effect on the town’s fortunes.  Storms in 1900, 1909, and 1913 were destructive to the community.  When oil was discovered in West Columbia in 1918, merchants abandoned East Columbia.  By the 1970s the town's post office had already closed and its population had decreased substantially.

Its northern boundary runs along East 24th Street from Bloomington Avenue to 17th Avenue South, then runs along East 22nd Street from 17th Avenue South to Hiawatha Avenue. Its other boundaries are Hiawatha Avenue to the east, East Lake Street to the south, and Bloomington Avenue to the west. The Phillips community has only been subdivided into smaller neighborhoods within the last couple years; the boundaries of East Phillips were officially designated on December 23, 2005. As this change has been fairly recent, most residents still refer to the area as just "Phillips".
