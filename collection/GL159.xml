      <p id="GL159_006_002" num_links="4">When Christian missionaries first arrived in the Marshall Islands, they introduced Latin script writing and orthographized the Marshallese language. Originally, Ebeye was written Ebeje by Europeans (Epjā in modern orthography, pronounced [ɛbʲ(ɛ)zʲæ]), which (according to elders of the atoll) means "making something out of nothing." However, the colonial <link wikipedia="Germany" osm="1683325355 51477 62781" type="node relation relation">German</link> administration mispronounced the J as if it were German language [j], and foreign observers recorded the resulting pronunciation as Ebeye. During the Japanese period, though, the island's pronunciation in katakana, Ebize (エビゼ) [ebʲize], re-approximated Marshallese. After <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>, the <link wikipedia="United_States" osm="424317935 148838" type="node relation">Americans</link> took possession of the regional mandate from <link wikipedia="Japan" osm="424313451 382313" type="node relation">Japan</link> and mispronounced the island's name as /ˈiːbaɪ/ EE-by from its spelling.  Because most of the modern Marshallese residents of Ebeye don't have family roots on the island, the American pronunciation has stuck, and is the usual name for Ebeye among the island's current population.  This pronunciation has even been adapted to Marshallese orthography, so that there are now two synonymous Marshallese names for the island –  officially and historically Epjā, and locally Ibae.

The city of Echo is named after Echo Koontz, daughter of JH Koontz and W  (Brassfield) Koontz, who were town promoters.[6]  Agriculture was the first draw, with alfalfa and corn being the main crops.  A town was platted by 1880, and the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company built a railroad through the Echo by 1883, which made the town a shipping point for wool, cattle and sheep during the early 1900s.  Echo was incorporated in 1904.

The area was initially settled in 1839, with the town laid out in 1849. Gold was discovered in 1852 and Echunga became the first proclaimed goldfield in South Australia. This led to a gold rush; however, it did not last long with the diggings exhausted and all but abandoned within a year. Subsequent discoveries in 1853 and 1854 led to smaller and equally short-lived rushes. In 1868 more gold was discovered at nearby Jupiter Creek, which proved to be a much larger and long-lived field.[3]

</p>
      <p id="GL159_210_002" num_links="2">Atwood purchased two locomotives and most of the passenger and freight cars when the Bridgton and Saco River Railroad was dismantled in 1941. After <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link> he acquired two former Monson Railroad locomotives and some surviving cars from the defunct Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad in <link wikipedia="Maine" osm="316961875 63512" type="node relation">Maine</link>. This equipment ran on 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge tracks, as opposed to the more common 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge in the western United States.  Atwood purchased the equipment for use on his 1,800-acre (730 ha) cranberry plantation in South Carver.  Sand and supplies were hauled in to the bogs, and cranberries were transported to a "screen house" where they were dried and then sent to market.   Atwood's neighbors were enchanted with the diminutive railroad.  At first, Atwood offered rides for free.  When the demand for rides soared, he charged a nickel a ride.  Eventually the line became less of a working railroad and more of a tourist attraction.[2](p42-47)

The hotel was designed for Harry Mufson, who was a then-estranged former partner of Fontainebleau owner, Ben Novack, who together had previously created another Miami Beach landmark hotel (the design of which Lapidus did not initiate, grant completed) located about a half-mile to the south, the Sans Souci (which opened in 1949). The Eden Roc site had previously been the Warner Estate, owned by Albert Warner of the <link wikipedia="Warner_Bros." osm="85709299" type="way">Warner Brothers</link>.  Mufson told Lapidus "I don't want any of the French stuff you used at the Fontainebleau. That's for kids."[3]  Novack was infuriated at both Lapidus and Mufson for building the Eden Roc, then considered one of the most elegant and luxurious hotels of its time, and retaliated in 1961 by building a blank 14-story North Tower as a "spite wall" on the Fontainebleau property to shade the Eden Roc's pool. All rooms faced south, and the side facing the Eden Roc consisted of an unpainted and unsightly "eye sore," in which the sole window, an oceanside penthouse on the north side, belonged to Novack, which he created for the purpose of "keeping an eye on" Harry and his guests at the Eden Roc. Mufson sued Novack in what would become one of the most acrimonious, personal legal architectural battles in Miami Beach history.[4][5][6]

Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age (2nd century AD), although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site continued at times to be a royal residence until 1633. From the 15th century the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half. As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745. Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100-year-old history, giving it a claim to having been "the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world".[2]

The traffic produced by the railway and by a tramway opened by the North London Tramways Company in 1881, brought a working class population to <link wikipedia="Edmonton,_London" osm="27365051" type="node">Lower Edmonton</link> and encouraged housing development and the development of Edmonton Green's outdoor market. This had always been the major centre for the village, but by the early 20th century its character had changed to a busy, raucous Cockney centre, alive with costermongers barrows and food stalls, the venue for travelling circuses and fairs. On several occasions the local council tried unsuccessfully to close down the market .[2]
