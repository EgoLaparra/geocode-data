He wrote the first science fiction novel, "Viaje maravilloso del señor Nic-Nac al planeta Marte" (Eng. "The Marvellous Journey of Mr. Nic-Nac to the Planet Mars"). In 1879, he wrote "Horacio Kalibang o los autómatas" (Eng. "Horacio Kalibang or The Automatons"), the first short science fiction story of Latin America.

Edzell Castle was begun around 1520 by David Lindsay, 9th Earl of Crawford, and expanded by his son, Sir David Lindsay, Lord Edzell, who also laid out the garden in 1604. The castle saw little military action, and was, in its design, construction and use, more of a country house than a defensive structure.[1] It was briefly occupied by English troops during Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Scotland in 1651. In 1715 it was sold by the Lindsay family, and eventually came into the ownership of the Earl of Dalhousie. It was given into state care in the 1930s, and is now a visitor attraction run by Historic Environment Scotland (open all year; entrance charge). The castle consists of the original tower house and building ranges around a courtyard. The adjacent Renaissance walled garden, incorporating intricate relief carvings, is unique in Scotland.[2] It was replanted in the 1930s, and is considered to have links to esoteric traditions, including Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry.

</p>
      <p id="GL160_131_002" num_links="2">There are not many traces of early habitation in the Eeklo area. It is presumed that some oaks would have attracted the attention of travellers on the Roman road that ran along the local sandbar among the marshes. By 1240, a town had grown here and had already become important enough to warrant a civic charter by Jeanne of Constantinople, Countess of Flanders. Over the years, the marshes were drained to give place to fortified farms, some remnants of which can still be seen today (Groot Goed). Like most other cities in the County of Flanders, Eeklo's economy was based on the cloth industry, and commercial relations were established with the more powerful neighbouring cities, <link wikipedia="Ghent" osm="1668655163 897671" type="node relation">Ghent</link> and <link wikipedia="Bruges" osm="1651558422 562654" type="node relation">Bruges</link>.

At the age of 15, he started to do martial arts.
His interest for K-1 started watching examples like Remy Bonjasky and Tyrone Spong on television. He googled the most nearby gym in <link wikipedia="Amsterdam" osm="268396336 271110" type="node relation">Amsterdam</link> and it so happened that he signed in for classes at Sityodtong Amsterdam. One year later he entered the ring for the first time. He won.
His nickname, The Immortal, was given to Eersel in this early amateur era. His teammates gave it to him, as he never used the break time between the rounds to sit and regain breath.
As it was not easy to find competitor in Holland after becoming a professional athlete in his weightclass, he tried his luck abroad. In Baku, Azerbeidzjan, Eersel took part of a K1-tournament, where he qualified for the finals. He did not win the finals, but the hunger for more had started. 
After this Eersel was invited for competitions in his country of birth Surinam, Russia (W5), Greece, Germany, Turkey (Mix Fight Gala), the US (Legacy and Lion Fight) and China (Wu Lin Feng, Glory of Heroes).

In Thomas Hardy: A Biography (1982), Hardy expert Michael Millgate suggests the small area of heath beside Hardy's birthplace at Upper Bockhampton as the origin of Egdon Heath, but Hardy  added to it areas near Puddletown, Bovington, and Winfrith. The small heath by Hardy's childhood home is much smaller than its fictional counterpart.  The ancient round barrows named Rainbarrows, and Rushy Pond, which lie immediately behind Hardy's childhood home, form the centre of the fictional heath.

In September 1848 a hurricane covered the island with six feet of water and damaged the new lighthouse. The keeper and his family rode out the storm in a small boat tied to a tree. When the keeper saw the damage to the lighthouse, he rowed off to <link wikipedia="Tampa,_Florida" osm="153970120" type="node">Tampa</link> and never returned. Another hurricane a few weeks later caused more damage, and beach erosion threatened to topple the tower. A hurricane in 1852 again threatened to topple the tower by undermining it. In 1857 work was begun rebuilding the tower. It apparently was moved 90 feet (27 m) inland at that time. The reconstruction was completed in 1858, and the lighthouse was placed back in service with a new third order Fresnel lens.  The lens was removed by Confederates during the Civil War to frustrate the Union Navy efforts to blockade <link wikipedia="Tampa_Bay" osm="369137717" type="node">Tampa Bay</link> but was restored after the war.

General operations began on 25 March 1871 at the opening of the railway from Trier to Gerolstein, including the section of line west of the station that became part of the Trier West Railway. The station building at Ehrang resembled those along this line, which were each built as small "palaces" (Schlösser). These were financed from the money that France had to pay as reparations to Germany after the <link wikipedia="Franco-Prussian_War" osm="2659504069 3671525642" type="node node">Franco-Prussian War</link>. It was expected that it would take many years to settle this debt. But in a one-time payment the whole debt was repaid. Now the German Empire could afford to erect these stations.[3] The design of the building in Ehrang comes from the famous architect Julius Carl Raschdorff, who also designed the stations of <link wikipedia="Kyllburg" osm="240059589 1140564" type="node relation">Kyllburg</link>, <link wikipedia="Bitburg-Erdorf_station" osm="291180357" type="node">Bitburg-Erdorf</link> and <link wikipedia="Speicher,_Germany" osm="240069715 1162788" type="node relation">Speicher</link>.[4]

The construction was almost entirely below ground, and the flow of the water was produced entirely by gravity. A few bridges, including one up to 1,400 metres (0.87 mi) in length, were needed to pass over valleys. Unlike some of the other famous Roman aqueducts, the Eifel aqueduct was specifically designed to minimize the above-ground portion to protect it from damage and freezing.

Until 1985, the Scharteberg transmitter used a 160 metre tall guyed mast. However this mast did not allow good reception in deep valleys, so in 1985 a new, 302 metre tall, guyed, steel framework mast was built, becoming the tallest structure of <link wikipedia="Rhineland-Palatinate" osm="519436857 62341" type="node relation">Rhineland-Palatinate</link>.
The elements of this mast were built by the firm of Hein, Lehmann AG, whilst construction work was carried out by BBS AG, Ludwigshafen. The first 20 metres of the mast were built using a small crane. The mast elements in heights between 20 and 100 metres were mounted by the aid of a car crane, while for the sections above a derrick crane was used.
The new mast of Scharteberg transmitter consists of a 288 metre tall, guyed, lattice, steel structure with a square cross section, a side length of 2.1 metres and a 14 metre long GFK-cylinder on top for the UHF antenna. The total weight of the structure is 204 tons.
The mast is guyed at 4 levels, 57, 123, 195 and 273 metres above ground. It is equipped with an elevator which runs up to a height of 281 metres.
For aircraft warning 20 red neon lamps and two blinking lights with 1000 watt lamps are installed.

The town's biggest claim to fame was the celebration of August 8, 1988 (08/08/88). People with an affinity for the number 8 descended upon the town from various parts of the nation and world, and the celebration was televised on national television. A similar celebration was held August 8, 2008 (08/08/08). National media coverage this time was usurped by the 2008 Summer Olympics.

The name is usually pluralised into "the Eildons" or "Eildon Hills", because of its triple peak. The 422 metres (1,385 ft) high eminence overlooks Teviotdale to the South.[1] The north hilltop (of three peaks) is surrounded by over 5 km (3.1 mi) of ramparts, enclosing an area of about 16 ha (40 acres) in which at least 300 level platforms have been cut into the rock to provide bases for turf or timber-walled houses, forming one of the largest hill forts known in Scotland.[2] A Roman army signalling station was later constructed on the same site as this hill fort.[3]
