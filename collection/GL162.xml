It is contained within the city's Rivers District. Containing the earliest-settled land in the Calgary area - Fort Calgary - East Village was for years a mixture of high-rise residential, commercial, and industrial development. Much of the parkland currently surrounding Fort Calgary was industrial as recently as the 1960s.[3] Construction of the city's light rail transit Blue Line, coupled with the closure of 8th Avenue at Macleod Trail in the early 1980s by construction of the massive Calgary Municipal Building, resulted in East Village being "cut off," figuratively speaking, from the rest of downtown.[4]  As a result, it became home to many rundown properties and vacant lots over the years, and a severe crime problem.[4]

      <p id="GL162_040_002" num_links="2">Norwich was settled by English colonists in the 17th century, and its first wharf was built in 1684.  It developed rapidly as a shipping port, with economic activity focused near the waterfront at the confluence of the <link wikipedia="Shetucket_River" osm="206332004 7400909" type="way relation">Shetucket</link>, <link wikipedia="Yantic_River" osm="7400910" type="relation">Yantic</link>, and Thames Rivers.  The downtown developed as a linear area just north of the main port area, Main Street forming an east-west axis.  The oldest surviving commercial building dates to 1742, and the oldest house to 1745.  A major fire in the downtown in 1793 encouraged a shift to brick construction, but growth was squelched by the economic blockades associated with the War of 1812.  The downtown's architecture is consequently dominated by Greek Revival andlate 19th and early 20th century architecture, which was built when the city was an important point for the transshipment of goods by either rail or ship.  By this time, the city's economy had diversified to include banking, textiles, and other water-powered industry.[2]  The downtown area includes many intact 18th and 19th-century buildings centered on the now-picturesque harbor.[3]

A major former freight house, built in 1875, is located north of the tracks and east of Main Street.  In 1889 the grade-level crossing of Main Street was replaced by a stone arch bridge; it and the stone embankment wall on the north side of Lyman Street were designed by H. H. Richardson.

It lies among forested hills of fir and oak.

In 1609 the dedication of the larger church was made to the "Descent of the Holy Spirit".
