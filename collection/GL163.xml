      <p id="GL163_002_003" num_links="3">The Elgin Tower Building, originally the Home Banks Building, is a historic office building in downtown <link wikipedia="Elgin,_Illinois" osm="153599677 125795" type="node relation">Elgin</link>, <link wikipedia="Illinois" osm="553784069 122586" type="node relation">Illinois</link>. The tower is 186 feet tall and 15 stories. It was built in 1929 to house the Home National Bank and Home National Savings and Trust. Though initially successful, the Great Depression devastated the bank only months later. The tower was again prosperous following <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>, when demand for Elgin goods increased. However, this prosperity was only temporary, and the tower again fell on hard times in the 1960s, particularly after the 1965 closing of the Elgin National Watch Company. The tower was eventually purchased by William R. Stickling, who went to great lengths to restore it. It was donated to a charity named in his honor following his 1999 death, and the William R. Stickling Charitable Foundation continues to maintain the structure. Its restoration is considered a major part of a hopeful rehabilitation of downtown Elgin. The tower is one of only two Art Deco buildings in Elgin and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.
An elevator in the building that had a wooden interior was destroyed by arson on May 4, 2014.[2] The building was then purchased in 2016 by Capstone Development and renovated into apartments.

The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad connected to the city in 1850, allowing Elgin to become a supplier of dairy products to <link wikipedia="Chicago" osm="153388690 122604" type="node relation">Chicago</link>. In 1865, the Elgin National Watch Company opened and became a major employer. The great success of Elgin National led other manufacturers to build factories within Elgin. Elgin's prosperity led to the opening of a number of banks by the late 19th century. The Elgin First National Bank opened in 1865 and was followed by the Home National Bank in 1872. The Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company opened in 1895, connecting Elgin with other Fox River Valley settlements, and the Aurora, Elgin and Chicago Railroad allowed easy access to and from Chicago in 1903. By 1920, downtown Elgin featured eleven clothing stores, two hotels, two department stores, and a Woolworth's. The Home National Bank was an important investor in these businesses, and often had to build extensions on its three-story building in Fountain Square. Home National Savings and Trust was responsible for managing the Elgin National payroll. Eventually, the bank's officials decided that the small building would no longer suffice, and ordered the construction of a new building in 1927.[3]

While advocating Lincoln's war policy, Washburne sponsored an up-and-coming Grant; they were acquainted because Grant had moved to Galena shortly before the war to work in his father's leather goods business.  Washburne advocated for Grant's promotions in the Union Army, and protected him from critics in Washington and in the field.  Washburne was Grant's advocate in Congress throughout the war, and their friendship and association lasted through Grant's two terms as president.

      <p id="GL163_089_002" num_links="3">In the two and a half centuries after its foundation, the school was often poorly-run with a number of principals being either dismissed or resigning following disputes with the local authorities, causing the Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey, Sir John Colborne, to establish a committee to perform a full review of the school. The school was subsequently re-chartered in 1824, with new staff and an improved curriculum to attract fee-paying pupils from <link wikipedia="England" osm="58447" type="relation">England</link> in place two years later. Its current main building was completed in 1829, on the same grounds as the original school, overlooking the town and harbour of Saint Peter Port.[2] During the German occupation of the Channel Islands, the school was evacuated to <link wikipedia="Great_Hucklow" osm="29417743" type="node">Great Hucklow</link>, <link wikipedia="Derbyshire" osm="88077" type="relation">Derbyshire</link>, where it was in 'exile' for five years.

A design competition was administered by the American Institute of Architects.

High quality limestone came from Indiana.  The building's lavish construction and interior decoration and artwork have caused it to be described as "one of the most magnificent war memorials in the world."[2]  The building features sculptures by Adolph A.

As with most of the Rhön Mountains its summit is more of a gently curving plateau. Near its highest point are the dwellings of Eisenacher Haus and Thüringer Rhönhaus. From the hill summit there is a good view over the Hohe Rhön ("High Rhön"), the Milseburg and the <link wikipedia="Wasserkuppe" osm="597327131" type="node">Wasserkuppe</link>, the latter being the highest mountain in the range. One and a half kilometres south of the Ellenbogen the Ellenbogen Plateau climbs to a small rise that is 2 metres higher than the official summit. This rise is the 815.5 m high Schnitzersberg, which is the highest mountain in the Thuringian Rhön. In spite of that some maps give the height of the Ellenbogen as 816 metres as well.

In June 2010 Rita Saffioti MLA stated that the population of Ellenbrook and neighbouring areas now stood at "over 25,000".[5]  Current City of Swan estimates forecast the population to increase to 37,150 by 2016 and 44,185 by 2021. Population in the City of Swan's nearby Urban Growth Corridor (roughly east of Whiteman Park) is forecast to reach 14,668 in the same period.[6]

The swamp was the hunting grounds of the Nanticoke Indian Tribe until they were driven out by the Lenni Lenape Tribe on the Battle Green near Chestnut Ridge, a hill on Ellendale's north side. The Lenape Trace, a main thoroughfare of a trail, passed through Ellendale as a Native American trade route from <link wikipedia="Pocomoke_City,_Maryland" osm="133691" type="relation">Pocomoke City, Maryland</link> to <link wikipedia="Marcus_Hook,_Pennsylvania" osm="187613" type="relation">Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania</link>. With the arrival of Europeans, the Ellendale area was a province of fur traders and hunters. Early in the 18th century, farming and timbering pushed back the swamp that once covered the area. The tract of land on which the town would later be built was originally deeded in 1740 as "Bennett's Pleasure".[5]

The Andrew Pickens Ranger district on the Sumter National Forest recommended the Ellicott Rock Extension as wilderness in 1995 in their Resource Management Plan. Although not fully designated, recommended wilderness is managed as if it were designated wilderness. In June 2017 during a land management plan revision, the Nantahala Ranger District on the Nantahala National Forest added 824 acres (3.33 km2) of proposed wilderness, currently called Ellicott Rock West Extension.
