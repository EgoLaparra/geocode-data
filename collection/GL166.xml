      <p id="GL166_031_002" num_links="2">Dunnville was the site of a Cayuga settlement called Detgahnegaha'gó:wah.[1] The European settlement was originally built as the entrance to the Welland "feeder" canal and the town once boasted several water-powered mills and a once-bustling canal port. The feeder canal closed in the late 1880s and the last mill was destroyed and replaced with a condominium complex about ten years ago. There is an impassable dam at Dunnville which regulates the level of the Grand River at Port Maitland which, in the 19th century, also helped regulate the level of the <link wikipedia="Welland_Canal" osm="7762554" type="relation">Welland Canal</link> (from 1829 until 1887 when the third canal began to intake its water directly from <link wikipedia="Lake_Erie" osm="4039900" type="relation">Lake Erie</link>). Dunnville was incorporated as a village in 1860 and then as a town in 1900. In 1974, the town amalgamated with the townships of Dunn, Canborough, Moulton and Sherbrooke when the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk was formed. In 2001, Dunnville and all other municipalities within the region were dissolved and the region was divided into two single tier municipalities with city-status but called counties. What was the incorporated town of Dunnville now consists of Wards 5 and 6 in Haldimand County.

The castle was built by Earl Thomas of Lancaster between 1313 and 1322, taking advantage of the site's natural defences and the existing earthworks of an Iron Age fort. Thomas was a leader of a baronial faction opposed to King Edward II, and probably intended Dunstanburgh to act as a secure refuge, should the political situation in southern England deteriorate. The castle also served as a statement of the earl's wealth and influence, and would have invited comparisons with the neighbouring royal castle of <link wikipedia="Bamburgh_Castle" osm="301645315 405517389" type="way way">Bamburgh</link>.

The promontory was enclosed by a curtain wall in the 13th century, and a four-storey tower house was built in the late 14th century. This tower was similar in style to contemporary structures at <link wikipedia="Kisimul_Castle" osm="207641244" type="way">Kisimul Castle</link> and <link wikipedia="Caisteal_Maol" osm="2492207884" type="node">Caisteal Maol</link>.[1] Alasdair Crotach, the 8th chief, added the Fairy Tower as a separate building around 1500. During the 17th century, new ranges of buildings were put up between the old tower and the Fairy Tower, beginning in 1623 with the state apartment built by Ruaraidh Mor. The old tower was subsequently abandoned until the late 18th century, when the 23rd chief began the process of homogenising the appearance of the castle. This process continued under the 24th and 25th chiefs, with the addition of mock battlements and the new approach over a drawbridge from the east. The present appearance of the castle dates from around 1840 when this process of "baronialisation" was completed.[1] The castle is a Category A listed building.[2]

The city functioned as the capital of Babylonia during the reign of Kurigalzu, and either as the capital or at least an important city during the period after.[2] It was occupied continuously until the fall of the Kassite Dynasty in the 12th century BC, when it was largely abandoned. The temple area, at least, was known to be active in the 7th century BC and in the Neo-Babylonian period. Up until recently (mostly between the 9th and 14th centuries AD), there have been smaller occupations at parts of Aqar Quf, with areas of the site being used for burials and for Arab settlement.[3]

Before the final Persian destruction of the town in 256-257 CE, parts of the synagogue which abutted the main city wall were apparently requisitioned and filled with sand as a defensive measure. The city was abandoned after its fall and never resettled, and the lower walls of the rooms remained buried and largely intact until excavated. The short measure of time during which it was used ensured that it would have limited impact upon Judeo-Christian art. The excavations also discovered very important wall-paintings from places of worship of Christianity at the Dura-Europos church. In addition, there were wall paintings edifying Mithraism, and fragmentary Christian texts in Hebrew.

Duradanda used to have six village development committees (VDCs) according to the older local body structure: Chandreshwor, Duradanda (sensu stricto), Dhuseni, Ishaneshwor, Neta, and Purankot. The new constitution has restructured the local bodies and these VDCs are formally non-existent. The name 'Duradanda' is composed of two terms: Dura= historical Dura tribes + danda= hill in Nepali. Duras inhabited this place from the historical times and were important political game players in the past, especially when Nepal was fragmented into 22–24 tiny Kingdoms, known as Bayise Chaubisi rajyas. Duradanda is considered to be the place of origin of the 'Dura' tribe. Duras have their own language and culture but are being forgotten because of an increasing influence from other cultures. Dura language, in fact, is no longer in use as the tribe uses the Nepali language. Only old generations knows the language, and not many people of this generation are alive at this time. Thus, Dura culture is in danger of being lost completely. Apart from Duras, Duradanda is also known for famous historical movements called 'Halo Kranti (ploughing movement)' and 'Siksha Kranti (educatioal movement)'. Sarvodaya High School (now, Sarbodaya Higher Secondary School) was one of the oldest school in the entire region of Central Nepal. Thus, people from very far places used to come to Duradanda to gain formal school education from Sarvodaya High School. At that time, young people who wanted to come here seeking school education from far villages used to say: "Duradanda kei chhaina tadha, janchhu ma ta sikshya ko khojima" meaning that "Duradanda is no longer far and I want to go there seeking my education". There were no hostels, so the youngesters used to live as guests (paying or free) in locals' houses, preferably relatives. In return, they had to bring commodities or to provide labor services for household and/or farm works.

The museum closed from 1995 to 1996 for a $22 million renovation project largely funded by Charles and Margre Durham.  For their contributions on the project, the Western Heritage Museum was renamed the Durham Western Heritage Museum the following year.  On April 6, 2008 the Durham Western Heritage Museum became the Durham Museum.  The change was driven by recent partnerships Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress and the National Archives which have provided the museum with a larger range of exhibits and programming not limited to western heritage.[2] The museum is an affiliate within the Smithsonian Affiliations program.[3]

Northwest of the Durreck are the last remnants of glaciation in the Durreck Group, the Klausenkees glacier, that still descended as low as 2,300 metres in 1910.[1] The whole area is part of the Rieserferner-Ahrn Nature Park.
