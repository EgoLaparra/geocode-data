It is a small town. Estanzuela was a passing place for Spaniards looking to go farther west to the ocean. A group of these Spaniards decided to rest for a while and thought Estanzuela to be the perfect location. As they went through the surroundings they saw that it was good land to harvest, so they decided to stay. At first, it was called "La Estancia". It is said that its second name was "La Estanzuelita," a Spanish diminutive of estancia, which is translated to resting place. Later, the name developed to today's name Estanzuela.

Crawford Long, a surgeon in <link wikipedia="Georgia_(U.S._state)" osm="316949496 161957" type="node relation">Georgia</link>, had previously administered sulfuric ether in 1842, but this went unpublished until 1849.[3][4] The Ether Dome event occurred when William Thomas Green Morton, a local dentist, used ether to anesthetize Edward Gilbert Abbott.

However, the ore was revealed to actually be cassiterite, a tin ore; this discovery caused dozens of new mines to spring up all over the Black Hills. Most of these mines were not successful because there was not a large amount of tin in the area.[2] The company built a mill and smelter in 1883. During the mining operations, a large lump of tin weighing 1,200 pounds (540 kg) was melted from hand-picked cassiterite deposits; the miners described it as being as "big as a small boy." This tin was displayed to potential shareholders in <link wikipedia="London" osm="107775 65606" type="node relation">London, England</link> in order to raise support for the company. However, the company dissolved after a lawsuit, and the mine ceased operation until 1898. That year, the mine began producing spodumene, a lithium ore, and became well known for its huge crystals. The largest spodumene crystal in the world was found in the mine. Until about 1900, Etta had the only post office in the Keystone area, and by that time, its population was 24.[3] In the 1920s, the mining operations flourished.[2] The mine shut down in 1959, and the town was eventually abandoned.[4] All that remains are the foundations of the smelter and mill, as well as the mine itself.[3]
