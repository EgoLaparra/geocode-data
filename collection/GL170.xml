In 1647, a church was built, sponsored by a Lithuanian noblewoman Dorota Giedraitytė-Daubarienė. This church was transferred to the Piarists in 1750. From 1777 to 1939, Dūkštos was known as Piarists' Dūkštos as the village was a center of the Piarists, who established a monastery and a school there. Dūkštos was popular with the Lithuanian Piarists as a resort in the 18th century. Piarists together with the Jesuits were active in the education field, establishing schools and academies. After the closure of other Piarist churches, monasteries, and educational establishments in Lithuania by the authorities of the Russian Empire, the last Piarist provincial and rector moved to Dūkštos. The new Romanticism style Dūkštos stone church designed by Tomasz Tyszecki and Friedrich Gustav von Schacht was built in 1850–1856.

In December 1973, the state announced that it would begin accepting bids for the construction of the span.[2] To be constructed as joint venture between the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company and the State of Alaska, the bridge was to be supported by tiers anchored to bedrock beneath the river. At its highest point, the span would rise approximately 200 feet (61 m) above the river with its length changing by nearly 2 feet (0.61 m) between the summer and winter months.[2] A consortium called Manson-Osberg-Ghemm was selected to construct the bridge with a bid of $31 million to be complete by December 1975.[4]

The first level windows feature wrought iron grill work, while those on the second level are smaller, or have wrought iron balconies.[3]

The tower was first lit in 1838 but had to be torn down because of physical defects. It was rebuilt in 1858 and operated by several families over the next century. In 1959 the light was automated, and five years later, over vehement local protests, the keeper's house was torn down and the bell was removed. The crew that removed the bell lost control of it, and it fell into the Bay.  A lobsterman salvaged it some years later and it is on exhibit on Great Spruce Head Island.

Ealing was settled as a railway village in the 1870s whilst the Main South Line's bridge over the Rangitata River was being built. Along with the schools in nearby Lynnford and Maronan, the local school was  shut due to population decline during the 1930s and students sent to the primary school in <link wikipedia="Hinds,_New_Zealand" osm="293132236" type="node">Hinds</link>, a small nearby town to the northeast.[2] The former school building is now the church. Ealing is more a common locality than a settlement, with the area being referred to as the "Ealing district". Each year a Guy Fawkes Night fireworks display and a Christmas party in Ealing District Hall are held to foster community spirit.

Earl Patrick is widely acknowledged to have been one of the most tyrannical noblemen in Scotland's history. He decided to extend the complex by building a new palace on the adjoining land.

Upon his imprisonment at <link wikipedia="Edinburgh" osm="5410114250" type="node">Edinburgh</link> in 1609, his bastard son Robert began a rebellion on his behalf and seized the palace, along with nearby St Magnus's Cathedral and Kirkwall Castle.

Its elevation is mostly between 1000 and 1500 metres. It is subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of mountain ranges, tablelands and hollows. The most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of hollows, due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the Earth's crust, the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes. Towards the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley (occupied by <link wikipedia="Lake_Malawi" osm="2631184" type="relation">Lake Nyasa</link>, or Lake Malawi), the southern part of which is less distinct due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system.

It is located nine miles west from Angleton.  It was one of the most important inland ports in Texas.  The river port became a vital component in the plantation-based economy that developed along the Brazos River in the 19th century. The community was founded in 1824 by Josiah Hughes Bell. A native of South Carolina, Bell came to Texas with Stephen F. Austin’s Old 300 colony in 1821.  Bell built a landing of log-lines docks and timbered stops on the Brazos River just below Varner’s Creek.  Bell laid out the town and called it Marion.  Bell sold the townsite to Walter C. White in 1827.  By the mid-1800s the town had a population of 800. The arrival of the railroad in the area led to the decline of steamboat traffic which had an adverse effect on the town’s fortunes.  Storms in 1900, 1909, and 1913 were destructive to the community.  When oil was discovered in West Columbia in 1918, merchants abandoned East Columbia.  By the 1970s the town's post office had already closed and its population had decreased substantially.
