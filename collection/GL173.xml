      <p id="GL173_024_002" num_links="2">Atwood purchased two locomotives and most of the passenger and freight cars when the Bridgton and Saco River Railroad was dismantled in 1941. After <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link> he acquired two former Monson Railroad locomotives and some surviving cars from the defunct Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad in <link wikipedia="Maine" osm="316961875 63512" type="node relation">Maine</link>. This equipment ran on 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge tracks, as opposed to the more common 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge in the western United States.  Atwood purchased the equipment for use on his 1,800-acre (730 ha) cranberry plantation in South Carver.  Sand and supplies were hauled in to the bogs, and cranberries were transported to a "screen house" where they were dried and then sent to market.   Atwood's neighbors were enchanted with the diminutive railroad.  At first, Atwood offered rides for free.  When the demand for rides soared, he charged a nickel a ride.  Eventually the line became less of a working railroad and more of a tourist attraction.[3](p42-47)

The Eden Roc site had previously been the Warner Estate, owned by Albert Warner of the <link wikipedia="Warner_Bros." osm="85709299" type="way">Warner Brothers</link>.  Mufson told Lapidus "I don't want any of the French stuff you used at the Fontainebleau. That's for kids."[3]  Novack was infuriated at both Lapidus and Mufson for building the Eden Roc, then considered one of the most elegant and luxurious hotels of its time, and retaliated in 1961 by building a blank 14-story North Tower as a "spite wall" on the Fontainebleau property to shade the Eden Roc's pool. All rooms faced south, and the side facing the Eden Roc consisted of an unpainted and unsightly "eye sore," in which the sole window, an oceanside penthouse on the north side, belonged to Novack, which he created for the purpose of "keeping an eye on" Harry and his guests at the Eden Roc. Mufson sued Novack in what would become one of the most acrimonious, personal legal architectural battles in Miami Beach history.[4][5][6]

Edgewood was developed during Atlanta’s Reconstruction-era economic boom that lasted from 1870 to 1910. With the extraordinary growth of Atlanta’s population during this time, and the development of an extensive core downtown business district, many forward-looking business and municipal leaders began to see the need for separate areas of recreation and residential development for the ever increasing numbers of those who worked downtown. Unlike other east side neighborhoods, Edgewood was geared primarily towards blue collar workers. As such, the Victorian architecture common in <link wikipedia="Kirkwood,_Atlanta" osm="153852293" type="node">Kirkwood</link> and Candler Park is noticeably absent in Edgewood, the neighborhood's housing stock being composed primarily of craftsman bungalows.[1]

Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age (2nd century AD), although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site continued at times to be a royal residence until 1633. From the 15th century the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half. As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745. Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100-year-old history, giving it a claim to having been "the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world".[2]

In 2003, after years of contentious negotiations with neighbors[3], Burke gained city approval to expand its facilities[4] with a new building which would increase both size and capacity. New computer labs, offices, classrooms, athletic facilities, a theater, and a large parking garage were built.[5]

Upon his death in 1863, the house passed to a son-in-law, and was deeded to the Industrial School in 1908.[2]  The house has been used as a classroom, an office building, an infirmary, a home economics practice home, and a summer home for male students.

Together with <link wikipedia="Florentino_Ameghino" osm="4218259862" type="node">Florentino Ameghino</link> he undertook the inventory of Argentine flora and fauna, and explored all the ecoregions in the country, summarizing for the first time the biodiversity of its territory. The son of botanical aficionado Eduardo Wenceslao Holmberg and grandson of the Baron Holmberg, Holmburg accompanied Argentine Libertador Manuel Belgrano on his campaigns and introduced the cultivation of the camellia to Argentina. As director of the <link wikipedia="Buenos_Aires_Eco-Park_(formerly_Zoo)" osm="10426130" type="way">Buenos Aires Zoological Garden</link> he greatly developed its scientific aspect, publishing booklets and providing printed media for a learned appreciation of its contents. He also directed the Natural History Cabinet of the University of Buenos Aires and published the standard reference works on botany and zoology used in his country for most of the 20th century. While less distinguished for his writing, he was arguably the first science fiction writer in Latin America.  He wrote the first science fiction novel, "Viaje maravilloso del señor Nic-Nac al planeta Marte" (Eng. "The Marvellous Journey of Mr. Nic-Nac to the Planet Mars"). In 1879, he wrote "Horacio Kalibang o los autómatas" (Eng. "Horacio Kalibang or The Automatons"), the first short science fiction story of Latin America.

The school's strengths and the specializations of its faculty are vast and many of its faculty members are the founders of theories or practices that are now commonplace in urban planning and policy.[2] Areas of expertise for Bloustein faculty members include transportation planning and the environment, while others (including former governor Jim Florio) have specialties in policy.  In 2018, a year long search for a new dean ended when Piyushimita (Vonu) Thakuriah was announced as dean.  Dr. Thakuriah's experience in both transportation and data science and the launch of a new graduate degree in Public Informatics signal the schools readiness top tackle the increasing pace of government innovation in the 21st century.[3]

Edzell Castle was begun around 1520 by David Lindsay, 9th Earl of Crawford, and expanded by his son, Sir David Lindsay, Lord Edzell, who also laid out the garden in 1604. The castle saw little military action, and was, in its design, construction and use, more of a country house than a defensive structure.[1] It was briefly occupied by English troops during Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Scotland in 1651. In 1715 it was sold by the Lindsay family, and eventually came into the ownership of the Earl of Dalhousie. It was given into state care in the 1930s, and is now a visitor attraction run by Historic Environment Scotland (open all year; entrance charge). The castle consists of the original tower house and building ranges around a courtyard. The adjacent Renaissance walled garden, incorporating intricate relief carvings, is unique in Scotland.[2] It was replanted in the 1930s, and is considered to have links to esoteric traditions, including Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry.

It was the seat of the Abbott, or Abbe, family, and was the centre of the now vanished original village of <link wikipedia="Edzell" osm="408767284" type="node">Edzell</link>.[4] The Abbotts were succeeded as lords of Edzell by the Stirlings of Glenesk, and the Stirlings in turn by the Lindsays.

By 1240, a town had grown here and had already become important enough to warrant a civic charter by Jeanne of Constantinople, Countess of Flanders. Over the years, the marshes were drained to give place to fortified farms, some remnants of which can still be seen today (Groot Goed). Like most other cities in the County of Flanders, Eeklo's economy was based on the cloth industry, and commercial relations were established with the more powerful neighbouring cities, <link wikipedia="Ghent" osm="1668655163 897671" type="node relation">Ghent</link> and <link wikipedia="Bruges" osm="1651558422 562654" type="node relation">Bruges</link>.
