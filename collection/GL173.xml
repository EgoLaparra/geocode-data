      <p id="GL173_314_002" num_links="3">The atoll was named in honor of Robert Townsend Farquhar in 1824.[1] Previous visitors had named it after Portuguese explorer João da Nova who commanded that nation’s third expedition to India during which he encountered Farquhar (in the year 1504). Administration of the atoll was a grey area for many years, with both <link wikipedia="Mauritius" osm="1708980402 535828 1569926" type="node relation relation">Mauritius</link> and <link wikipedia="Seychelles" osm="424298277 536765" type="node relation">Seychelles</link> claiming the right to administer it. In 1881 the authorities in Seychelles suggested Farquhar, along with several other outer islands, be administered from Victoria in Seychelles rather than from Mauritius. There were objections as the owners were based in Mauritius but after considerable argument, the owners lost their case and administration was passed from Mauritius to Seychelles.
Fishing camps were established on north islands in 1850 [2]
In 1960, the village on the northern tip of South Island was abandoned.[3]
From 1965 to the independence of the Seychelles in 1976, Farquhar was a part of the <link wikipedia="British_Indian_Ocean_Territory" osm="424313891 1993867" type="node relation">British Indian Ocean Territory</link>.[4]
In 2004 there were renovations in the village.[5]
In 2014 Island Conservation Society opened a Conservation Centre on North Island.[6][7] On 16 April 2016 Farquhar Atoll was hit by Cyclone Fantala, the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the south-west Indian Ocean, which destroyed most of the buildings except for the cyclone shelter. The Islands Development Company (IDC) has started the rehabilitation of the island and to date has rebuilt the guest house which offers catch and release flyfishing trips that are operated by Alphonse Fishing Company.

The castle could only be reached by a drawbridge over a narrow ravine, protected by a barbican. Little remains today of the keep or the courtyard walls except foundations, and a section of the north-east wall.[2] The layout of the castle is very similar to that of <link wikipedia="Dunnottar_Castle" osm="504422636" type="way">Dunnottar Castle</link> in <link wikipedia="Aberdeenshire" osm="1900655" type="relation">Aberdeenshire</link>, though Fast Castle is on a smaller scale.
