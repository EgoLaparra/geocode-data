Its inhabitants are nicknamed the "Turks" by the neighbouring towns and villages.  It is believed that the inhabitants refused to join the crusades against the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, and were called as Turks consequently. Another (more likely) reason could be that the inhabitants did not have to pay the taxes collected by the monks of the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy for the war against the Turkish empire, since Faymonville was part of the Duchy of Luxembourg, contrary to the other Walloon villages of the area.  The inhabitants of these villages therefore would have called the inhabitants of Faymonville the "Turks".  To protest, the latter adopted crescent and star as their symbols wearing them and dressing their building. This later became a tradition.  It was even once told that when the villagers were to gather in the church, they did not use the bells but a call to church like the call to prayer in Turkey.  This has however never been really assessed and should be viewed more as a legend.  Every year the town celebrates their connection to Turks and the inhabitants now call themselves Turks.

At its deepest point, Lake Federsee has a depth of 2 metres (6.5 feet). Federsee translates to 'feather lake' and its shape resembles that of a feather. However, the origin of its name is locally debated, with one camp defending the shape theory, and another championing the idea that the amount of feathers found on the lake's surface gave rise to its name. The most probable explanation for the origin of the name is, however, the Celtic word "pheder" which means marsh. Therefore, the name refers to the origin of the lake itself and the surrounding landscape.

      <p id="GL174_497_001" num_links="3">According to the folk tradition, the monastery was built in the second half of the 15th century  and its founders were Stefan and Аngelina Branković. The first written record[2] about the monastery is found in the minej (a religious book) of the monk Zaharije from 1563. Unlike other Fruška gora monasteries, Fenek remained under the Ottoman government until 1717. The records from the 18th century testify that the old monastery church was built in the second half of the 15th century in the spirit of Serbian medieval architecture. The new church was built in the period from 1793-1797, and consecrated during the time when Vikentije Rakić was the abbot; he also wrote the history of the monastery.  The monastery chapel dedicated to <link wikipedia="Parascheva_of_the_Balkans" osm="641854087" type="way">St Petka</link> was built in 1800, on the site of the old one, above the well, which was believed to have been built by the mother Angelina Branković. People believed that the water from this well had some healing powers.[3] By the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the Fenek Monastery was the venue of the several historical events. In 1788, duke Аleksa Nenadović and Austrian emperor Јоsef II met in the monastery. After the collapse of the First Serbian Uprising in 1813 Karađorđe and his son Aleksa stayed in a monastery for a month. There is a memorial plaque as a testimony. Also on the same occasion, until 1815, monks from <link wikipedia="Studenica_Monastery" osm="206182687" type="way">Studenica</link> stayed there, along with the relics of St. King Stefan Prvovenčani.
