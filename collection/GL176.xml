It was drained by the digging of canals in the first half of the eighteenth century, and initially served as parkland, hosting a tavern, post office and the royal menagerie. Popular with the nobility, several leading figures of Petrine society established their town houses around the space in the mid eighteenth century. Under <link wikipedia="Peter_the_Great" osm="6204100696" type="node">Peter the Great</link> it was laid out with paths for walking and riding, and hosted military parades and festivals. During this period, and under Peter's successors it was called the "Empty Meadow" and the "Great Meadow".  Empresses Anna and Elizabeth built their Summer Palaces here, and it was redeveloped into a pleasure park with pavilions and walkways for promenading. Theatres were built on the land during this period, and with the imperial patronage, the square became the "Tsaritsyn Meadow". New townhouses and palaces developed along the square's boundaries and across its frontage onto the <link wikipedia="Neva_River" osm="1114249 2599821 2811903" type="relation relation relation">Neva</link>. During the reigns of Emperor Paul I and his son Alexander I, the square took on more of a martial purpose, with the construction of military monuments in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In acknowledgement of this, and its role in hosting military reviews and parades, it was renamed the "Field of Mars" in 1805.

Steve Rebeil and Dominic Magliarditi, both of Gem Gaming, were the project developers. Later in 1996, Ameristar Casinos planned to purchase Gem Gaming, and construction slowed down to allow for an expanded redesign of the project, which was then expected to open between March and April 1997.

Ameristar Casinos ultimately opened The Reserve on February 10, 1998, with an African safari/jungle theme, although the resort failed to generate a substantial profit. In 2001, The Reserve was purchased by Station Casinos, which renovated and reopened the hotel-casino as the southwestern party-themed Fiesta Henderson.

Built by the main Swedish film producer at the time, Svensk Filmindustri, in 1919–1920, Filmstaden was one of the most modern film studios in Europe. Some 400 movies have been created at Filmstaden. The first movie to be filmed at Filmstaden was The Phantom Carriage by director Victor Sjöström. Practically all Swedish actors and film directors of the 20th century had some connection with Filmstaden. In 1969, Svensk Filminstustri finally left Filmstaden, and the studios were used by small film producers, production of television dramas and the Riksteatern Theatre. One of the last major films to partly have been filmed at Filmstaden was The Emigrants. Most of the buildings were quite well preserved until the beginning of the 21st century when Filmstaden had to make way for a housing development. Some buildings, however, have been renovated and Svensk Filmindustri has moved its headquarters back to a former studio building.

The Gaelic name of the village was recorded[when?] by Diack[clarification needed] using his own transcription method as fanna-guchti, which is of unclear meaning. One of the earliest references to Findochty is in 1440, when the king granted Findachtifeild to John Dufe, son of John Dufe. The lands passed from the Duffs to the Ogilvies of Findlater, and subsequently, in 1568, the Ord family acquired the manor, port, custom, and fishers' lands of Findochty, and later built the House of Findochty, known as Findochty Castle, now a ruin, which stands to the west of the village. In 1716 the Ords brought 13 men and 4 boys from Fraserburgh under contract to fish from Findochty, and for a time the harbour was busy with landings of herring and white fish. Findochty expanded as a fishing port through the 1700s and 1800s, and by 1850 was home to 140 fishing boats. But the expansion in the late 1800s of nearby <link wikipedia="Buckie" osm="31818758" type="node">Buckie</link> provided a better harbour, and some of the fishing fleet had left Findochty by 1890. Findochty harbour is now used mostly by pleasure craft and is a good sun spot when the tide is out. A local artist, Correna Cowie, created a statue in 1959 of a seated fisherman, known as The Mannie, who watches over the harbour.

The two granite columns at the main entrance, 3 feet 8 inches (1.12 m) in diameter and 12 feet 10 inches (3.91 m) high, were said to be the largest polished monolithic shafts in the country.[3] The interior features Art Nouveau motifs and murals by artists such as Martha Susan Baker, Frederic Clay Bartlett, Oliver Dennett Grover, Frank Xavier Leyendecker, and Bertha Sophia Menzler-Peyton dating from the 1898 renovation.

Local furnaces produced pig iron and later the quarries supplied ore for the steel works at Corby. A disused quarry face in the south of the parish is a geological SSSI.

The death toll among prisoners of war and the guards was high, especially in the latter part of 1863 and throughout 1864. By July 1863, there were 12,595 prisoners on the island at nearby Fort Delaware which was only about 75 acres (30 ha) in size.  Disease was rampant and nearly 2,700 prisoners died from malnutrition or neglect.  Confederate prisoners interred at the cemetery totaled 2,436 and all are in a common grave as can still be seen as a huge pit in the north western corner of the site near the monument.

The original steeple, which rose 145 feet (44 m) above the ground, was removed in 1945. The stone base was sinking into the marshy soil and causing structural strain on the rest of the building. A new, shorter steeple was erected, but without the belfry and clock that the original steeple had.[2]
