      <p id="GL177_003_002" num_links="3">First Canadian Place is named for Canada's first bank, the Bank of Montreal. Designed by B+H Architects with Edward Durell Stone as design consultant, First Canadian Place was constructed in 1975 and originally named First Bank Building. The tower and associated buildings occupy a block once home to two major newspapers, the Toronto Star’s Toronto Star Building and The Globe and Mail's William H. Wright Building. The site was the last of corners of King and Bay to be redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, and a major bidding war began over the property. The then little known firm of Olympia and York eventually obtained nearly the whole city block, though the election of reformist mayor David Crombie led to new rules banning skyscrapers and it took three years of lobbying before permission for First Canadian Place was granted. When completed, the building was nearly identical in appearance to Stone's <link wikipedia="Aon_Center_(Chicago)" osm="64388609" type="way">Aon Center</link> in <link wikipedia="Chicago" osm="153388690 122604" type="node relation">Chicago</link>, <link wikipedia="Illinois" osm="553784069 122586" type="node relation">Illinois</link>;[6] completed two years previous as the Standard Oil Building, the Chicago tower is of the same floor plan and clad in the same marble,[7] the only overtly visible difference being the vertical orientation of the windows, as opposed to the horizontal run of those on First Canadian Place.

It was designed in the redbrick Colonial Revival style by Densmore, LeClear and Robbins, architects. Due to cost constraints, its steeple was added later.[1] In September, 2004, the church sold its building for $1,050,000 to be converted into apartments.[2] The church in 2007 held services in rented rooms at 300 Walnut Street in the Masonic Building.,[3] but is now meeting at 1141 Walnut Street, in Newton Highlands. The building has since been divided into 11 condominium units.[4] It is now called the Oxford House,[5][6] and was the city's first inclusionary zoning project.[7]

As a result, the congregation was frequently left without a preacher and forced to look to New England for new ministers.  Among these men was William Henry Channing, who served the congregation from 1839 to 1844.[2]:348  Following Channing was the former lawyer James H. Perkins, who drowned in 1849; during his five years of ministry, he engaged the congregation in a range of social justice purposes, such as prison reforms and welfare for the poor.[2]:349  Controversy arose in the 1850s: questions of abolitionism were tense in a city located so close to the slave state of <link wikipedia="Kentucky" osm="316959037 161655" type="node relation">Kentucky</link>, and theological differences over the existence of miracles caused the church to split into two.  These tensions were resolved in the 1870s: both congregations had come to reject the existence of miracles, and the Thirteenth Amendment had ended slavery throughout the United States.[2]:350  Under the ministry of George Thayer, which began in 1882, the congregation was faced with widespread movement of members from downtown to the city's northern edges; as a result, the present building was erected along <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_42" osm="168032" type="relation">Reading Road</link>, 2 miles (3.2 km) northeast of the former site.[2]:351

In the summertime, the road to Fish Creek Falls becomes often clogged in mid-afternoon with tourists wanting to see the 283-foot-tall (86 m) waterfall. It is possible to hike all the way to the terminus of the waterfall through giant boulders and rushing water. There are two hiking trails from the parking lot at the end of Fish Creek Fall Road. One is 1/4 of a mile (400 m) and goes through several Aspen groves with the occasional Subalpine Fir. It ends at a viewing station where the entirety of the falls can be seen. The other trail goes straight down into the U-Shaped valley formed by glaciers. As it nears the bottom of the valley, one can hear the rushing sound of water over the fall and see beautiful Fish Creek. The trail continues on to Upper Fish Creek Falls and then on to the Wyoming Trail, a long trail running the northwestern mountains of Colorado to <link wikipedia="Wyoming" osm="317007393 161991" type="node relation">Wyoming</link>. The falls provide a great place for ice climbing in the winter when 300+ inches of snow (7.6 m) fall on the mountains east of Steamboat Springs.

In the Fisher House, Kahn eschews the linearity of the modern plan and focuses on a simple geometry, allowing the cubes to provide a separation of public and private space. Known widely for monumental works like the <link wikipedia="Salk_Institute_for_Biological_Studies" osm="31839360 31842306 31844209 31844744" type="way way way way">Salk Institute</link> and the Richards Medical Center, the Fisher house stands as a testament to Kahn’s ability to work with the details of small residential architecture. The Fisher House stands as the clearest example of Kahn's unique architectural style at the time, his use of the two almost perfect cubes differing greatly from much of what was being done at the time and setting him apart in his own field of design.

The area became more commercial in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to the opening of railroad tracks and the discovery of a mineral water well. Visitors came for the therapeutic value of the mineral water, but when the well went dry in 1914 the area began its reversion to being a primarily residential area. Fisherville is also home of one of Louisville's great Basketball coaches, Denny Crum, who coached for the University of Louisville for 30 years attaining 2 Men's Basketball Championships.

The Fiskeville textile mill was formed by Dr. Caleb Fiske, a Revolutionary War doctor turned businessman in 1812.[3] The village became home to those who worked in the mill, mostly immigrants from Portugal, France, Italy and England.[4] Fiskeville is usually associated with Cranston rather than with Scituate as most of the original buildings including Dr. Fiske's residence were in Cranston. Although the mill and about a dozen nearby mill houses were in Scituate. Poets Karen Haskell and Darcie Dennigan both grew up, a few doors down from each other, in the 1970s and 1980s on Main Street in Fiskeville. [5]

The original lighthouse consisted of a 30-foot (9.1 m) octagonal wooden tower built in 1805 by Abisha Woodward. In 1847, a new 80-foot (24 m) octagonal tower was constructed by Marcus Bassett with East Haven brownstone.  This new beacon was illuminated by 12 lamps with reflectors which were positioned 97 feet (30 m) above sea level. Also constructed at this time was a two-and-one-half story brick house which supplanted the previous, deteriorating keeper's dwelling.  A fourth-order Fresnel lens replaced the lamps in 1855 and a fog bell was added in the 1860s. The Five Mile Point Light was deactivated in 1877 when the nearby <link wikipedia="Southwest_Ledge_Light" osm="497739101" type="node">Southwest Ledge Light</link> was completed.  Currently, the lighthouse is contained within <link wikipedia="Lighthouse_Point_Park" osm="43398000" type="way">Lighthouse Point Park</link> and, along with the keeper's house, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

A flag was raised by the local farmer when a steamer passed to alert the port authorities in the settlement 7 km further south.
