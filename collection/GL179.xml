With the support of the <link wikipedia="Marion_County,_Indiana" osm="1812962" type="relation">Marion County</link> legislators the bill passed the House easily: however, it did not reach the Senate floor until the closing days of the General Assembly, On the next to last day of the legislature, Senator Thompson of Marion County was persuaded to sponsor the bill.

However, some sources indicate that the town was founded as early as 1850.  The town shows on the 1852 Gibbes map as Empire.  It is alleged to have been almost destroyed and deserted twice, in 1852 and 1855.  The town served as the head of navigation for steamboats on the Tuolumne River. Empire City became the county seat of <link wikipedia="Stanislaus_County,_California" osm="396514" type="relation">Stanislaus County</link>, and was flooded in the Great Flood of 1862. In 1896, the town relocated one mile north of the river, and was renamed Empire for the Santa Fe Railroad.

      <p id="GL179_341_002" num_links="2">The design was chosen by unanimous vote of the Families and Survivors Memorial Committee, out of 320 qualified entries in the international design competition.[1] The memorial is dedicated to 746 New Jerseyans killed in the World Trade Center in 1993 and in the September 11 attacks, as well as those who died on September 11, 2001, at <link wikipedia="The_Pentagon" osm="89605" type="relation">the Pentagon</link> and in <link wikipedia="Shanksville,_Pennsylvania" osm="189076" type="relation">Shanksville, Pennsylvania</link>.[2]  The New Jersey 9/11 Memorial Foundation has stated that the goal of this memorial is to "reflect the legacies of those whose lives were lost, that their unfulfilled dreams and hopes may result in a better future for society. Their unique qualities and characteristics enriched our lives immeasurably and through this memorial, their stories live on.[2]
The memorial includes twin walls, transecting a "gently sloped mound anchored by a granite path that is directed toward Ground Zero.[2] Two 30-foot (9.1 m)-high rectangular towers stretch 208 feet 10 inches (63.65 m) long—the exact width of the World Trade Center towers, the proportion of the walls a symbolic representation of the buildings as if they were lying on their sides.[2] The name of each of the 746 victims is etched in stainless steel in 4-inch (10 cm) letters. A granite passage is oriented to face the site of the twin towers.[2][3] The name of the memorial is taken from the Bruce Springsteen song "Empty Sky", which is about the "empty sky" where the towers once stood.[4]

The territory was inhabited during Prehistoric and Roman times, and became a trade settlement during the 10th century. From the 11th century it was part of the domain of the Benedictine abbey of Saint Salvator, until its 1795 dissolution in the aftermath of the French Revolution. 
The remains of the Saint Salvator abbey are today part of a major heritage project in Flanders, established by the Province of East-Flanders. The Provincial Archaeological Museum of Ename displays the major finds that have been excavated on the abbey site.
Today the village of Ename hosts the Museumnacht in July and the Feeste t’ Ename with the traditional horse market that has been held for centuries during the celebrations of the patron hallow <link wikipedia="Saint_Lawrence" osm="293534851" type="node">Saint Laurentius</link>, on the 10th of August.

It is certified by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The Center was founded in 1971 by renowned naturalist Marlin Perkins and his wife Carol, who saw that wolves around the world were in danger of becoming extinct. Its mission is to preserve and protect Mexican wolves, red wolves, and other wild canid species, with purpose and passion, through carefully managed breeding, reintroduction and inspiring education programs.[2]  Animals born at the facility have been reintroduced to North Carolina (red wolves) and Arizona and New Mexico (Mexican wolves). The Center's research focuses on reproductive, behavioral and nutritional needs for the species housed there. The Endangered Wolf Center is a founding member of the AZA’s Mexican Wolf and Red Wolf Species Survival Plans. As of August 2016, the Center had six species of endangered canids: Mexican wolves, red wolves, maned wolves, African painted dogs, fennec foxes and swift foxes. It had more than 20 Mexican gray wolves, more than any other managed breeding facility. (Only 97 Mexican wolves were known to exist in the wild as of 2015.) The Center serves as the cornerstone of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's program to preserve Mexican wolves and reintroduce them to the wild.

      <p id="GL179_498_002" num_links="8">Enfield was originally inhabited by the Pocomtuc tribe, and contained their two villages of Scitico and Nameroke. Though land grants were first granted in 1674, no one attempted to settle what is known as Enfield until 1679 when the Pease Brothers of Robert and John II, settlers from <link wikipedia="Salem,_Massachusetts" osm="158853736 9396968" type="node relation">Salem, Massachusetts</link> came in to settle the fertile lands. They dug a shelter into a bill and camped there for the winter until their families came to help them build houses. In 1675, a sawmill owned by William Pynchon II was burned in the wake of King Phillip's War. The first town meeting was held on August 14, 1679 and a committee of five were appointed by men from <link wikipedia="Springfield,_Massachusetts" osm="158818678 1181618" type="node relation">Springfield</link> as it was the parent town at the time.

The namesake is the Freshwater Brook (Also known as the Asnuntuck Brook) that traverses the town.

It is unclear what claim Notatuck actually had to the land, or whether he was selling the land or the rights to use it.
