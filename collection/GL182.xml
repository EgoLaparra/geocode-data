Fort d'Epinette was built in 1806 by the North West Company. It was renamed Fort St. John in 1821 following the purchase of the North West Company by the Hudson's Bay Company. This fort was located about 500 metres downstream from the mouth of the Beatton River, which at that time was known as the Pine River (d'epinette in French). It was shut down in 1823.

Prior to World War I the fort was probably manned by over 1,000 soldiers. During World War II, two batteries of 3-inch guns (Basinger and Stevens) defended channel minefields, but the big guns and other 3-inch batteries (except for the AA guns) were decommissioned. Declared surplus in 1947, the fort served as a <link wikipedia="Project_Nike" osm="119886265 119886316 119886352" type="way way way">Nike missile</link> site until 1961, and was redeveloped in 2005-2009 for a children's summer camp and later a homeless shelter.[1] However, in 2014 the island's bridge was demolished due to safety concerns, and all activities were removed.[2][3]

      <p id="GL182_095_001" num_links="7">Fort Vancouver was a 19th-century fur trading post that was the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company's Columbia Department, located in the Pacific Northwest.

Two rival fur trading outfits, the Canadian North West Company (NWC) and the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC), had until then both operated in the region peaceably. Funded largely by John Jacob Astor, the PFC operated without many opportunities for military defense by the United States Navy. News of the war and of a coming British warship put the American company into a difficult position. In October 1813, management met at <link wikipedia="Fort_Astoria" osm="328470620" type="way">Fort Astoria</link> and agreed to liquidate its assets to the NWC.

The fur trading post at Victoria was minor compared to Edmonton but soon attracted a small agricultural settlement around itself much like that at other H.B.C. posts at this time.

For several miles on each side of the present-day museum the river lot system is still in use, the farm here predating the large, square tracts of the Dominion Lands Act which surround them.

On one hand, the constructors reused the capitals, presupposing a public construction that occurred in the High Middle Ages.[3] On the other hand, successive remodelling, painting and lack of prior archaeological excavations has made rigorous analysis impossible; this lack of information has contributed to the difficulty in dating and contextualizing the style of architecture.[3] Despite a lack of archaeological research, scholars believe that at the time of the Muslim invasion of the Iberian peninsula, the site was already a military fortification.

In 1875, the name was changed to Springville during the construction of the Springville Mill, a lumber mill for the nearby <link wikipedia="Sequoia_sempervirens" osm="1998671446" type="node">redwood</link> forests, named so because of the numerous springs in the area. The mill's owners were Henry Rohner (namesake of neighboring <link wikipedia="Rohnerville,_California" osm="141040419" type="node">Rohnerville</link>), Alexander Masson, M. N. Weber and G. F. Gushaw. Springville was originally a company town belonging to the mill, and the few people that resided there all worked at the mill. By the late 1870s Springville had grown enough to warrant a post office, but a town called Springville, California (now part of Camarillo, in Ventura County) already existed in the state. The post office was named Slide on May 24, 1876.[7][9] In 1884 the residents petitioned the state legislature for the name Fortuna, Spanish for "fortune" and Latin for "chance," and by July 3, 1888 the name was changed to Fortuna.[7][10] The name was chosen when settlers saw the proximity of the forests, the river and its valley, and the Pacific Ocean, as ideal for enjoying a good quality of life, and felt "fortunate" to live there.[10] It is believed that a local minister and real estate agent, desiring to sell lots to newcomers, devised the name as a marketing tool.[9][10]

Rather, it was constructed with the intent that as one sailed from Mackinaw Point to the Saint Clair River, one would never be out of viewing range of a lighthouse.[3]  With no river or harbor to use for a name, the light is named on the basis that it is 40 miles (64 km) sailing distance from Mackinaw Point.

The 26.3-square-kilometre (10.2 sq mi) island makes up the majority of the land area of the municipality. The island is located east of the Fedjefjorden and south of the Fensfjorden. The island of Radøy lies just south of Fosnøyna and the mainland of the Lindås peninsula lies immediately to the east of Fosnøyna. The highest point on the island is the 56-metre (184 ft) high Bredvikvarden. The island has some trees on it, but the northern part is fairly barren and rocky while the southern part is more marshy. There are two larger villages on the island: the village of Austrheim and the municipal centre of Årås. The island is connected to the mainland road network by two bridges. A series of small bridges connects Fosnøyna to the mainland of Lindås, west of Mongstad and the other connects the south end of Fosnøyna to the island of Radøy (which in turn is connected to the mainland.[1]
