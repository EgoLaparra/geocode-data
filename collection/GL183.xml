The trail through the valley, which developed into a wagon road whose roadgrade is largely used by today's road through the valley, climbs a steep grade from its southern end, near Fountainview Farms on the Fraser, and descends relatively gently towards Fountain.  The three lakes in the valley, which give it its official name, are Cinquefoil Lake, Kwotlenemo Lake (aka Fountain Lake), and Chilhil Lake, the three of them collectively being known as the Fountain Lakes""  There are many recreational dwellings and small ranches forming a community in the valley, which is something of a rural "suburb" of Lillooet.

The area was made available for Christian use by Emperor Alexander Severus when he settled a dispute between the Christians and tavern-keepers, saying, according to the Liber Pontificalis "I prefer that it should belong to those who honor God, whatever be their form of worship." In 340, when Pope Julius I (337–352) rebuilt the titulus Callixti on a larger scale, it became the titulus Iulii in commemoration of his patronage and one of the original 25 parishes in Rome.[citation needed]

Chartered by the Maine legislature in 1823, Foxcroft Academy was established just a few years after the incorporation of the town of Foxcroft itself.  From modest beginnings in a wood frame building for which the town appropriated $100, the Academy now occupies a 125-acre campus with a full complement of academic, athletic, and residential facilities. Today more than 350 day students are enrolled from the surrounding towns of Dover-Foxcroft, Sebec, Charleston, Bowerbank, Monson, and Harmony, with an additional 100 international students hailing from Canada, China, Czech Republic, Ethiopia, France, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam. Foxcroft Academy is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and a member of the Independent School Association of Northern New England, College Board and the National Association of Independent Schools.

      <p id="GL183_249_002" num_links="5">The village of Foxville was settled in the late 18th century by second-generation German immigrants to the United States as they moved southward from their original settlements in <link wikipedia="Pennsylvania" osm="316987717 162109" type="node relation">Pennsylvania</link>. Early settlers in Foxville included the Brown, Fox, Wolfe, Hauver, and Poorman (Buhrman) families.[2] Foxville was situated on the main road leading between <link wikipedia="Hagerstown,_Maryland" osm="158519358 133712" type="node relation">Hagerstown</link> and <link wikipedia="Emmitsburg,_Maryland" osm="133697" type="relation">Emmitsburg</link>. The Wolfe family built a tavern along this route circa 1800.[3] As the area became more permanently settled in the early 19th century, the developing village took the name of Foxville from the area's largest landowners, the Fox family.[4] In 1830, Mount Moriah Lutheran Church was organized and erected a stone building on the northern edge of the village. A few years later, the Mount Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church was established in 1836 and constructed a log building approximately one mile south of the village. In the latter half of the 19th century, the village further developed with the establishment of a public school, wagon shop, and general store, operated by Thomas Fox, a third-generation descendant of the original settlers.[5] In 1877, Mount Moriah Lutheran Church was largely rebuilt and Mount Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church erected a new building in 1902. During the Great Depression, WPA workers constructed Camp Hi Catoctin on the mountain a few miles northwest of Foxville as a retreat for Federal Government employees and their families. In 1942, President <link wikipedia="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" osm="1610589818" type="node">Franklin D. Roosevelt</link> converted the camp into a presidential retreat called Shangri-La. President Dwight D. Eisenhower renamed the retreat <link wikipedia="Camp_David" osm="45405589" type="way">Camp David</link> during his administration. The Eisenhowers donated a significant library of books to the Foxville School, where the children of some of the workers at Camp David attended. Closed in 1962, Foxville's school was the last two-room school in operation in Frederick County, Maryland.[6]

An early motte and bailey or ringwork Norman castle was built on the Framlingham site by 1148, but this was destroyed by Henry II of England in the aftermath of the revolt of 1173–4. Its replacement, constructed by Roger Bigod, the Earl of Norfolk, was unusual for the time in having no central keep, but instead using a curtain wall with thirteen mural towers to defend the centre of the castle. Despite this, the castle was successfully taken by King John in 1216 after a short siege. By the end of the 13th century, Framlingham had become a luxurious home, surrounded by extensive parkland used for hunting.

Francis traded the duchy to the ex-Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany as one of the terms ending the War of the Polish Succession in November 1738. The duchy and the ducal title to Lorraine and Bar passed to King Louis XV of France upon Leszczynski's death in 1766, though Francis and his successors retained the right to style themselves as dukes of Lorraine and Bar.

The Franciscans were able to rebuild their church, as well as the adjoining monastery. The church was finally finished with the completion of the main altar in the mid-1970s. The street itself was rebuilt in 1949, with most of the buildings, constructed in what was at the time a "model" socialist housing style, occupied in 1950. (There was one exception: an apartment building that survived the war and, although dilapidated, remained occupied until the late 1970s, when it was torn down and a new building put in its place.) The new buildings were occupied by workers of the PWPW, the state printing concern a few blocks over, where money was being printed before the war as well after. Ironically, because the PWPW was built to include the government bunkers in case of war, it was literally impossible to tear down after the war.

Later on, the Home and Studio became an apartment building. In the 1960s it fell into disrepair as the owners began to neglect the property due to financial problems. The longtime roofing company entrusted by Frank Lloyd Wright, Oak Park-based Tuscher Roofing, took control of the property. In 1974, the structure was handed over to the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the 13-year restoration began.[6]
