However, this did not end the contest. In 1772, land surveyors John Collins of Quebec and Thomas Valentine of New York erected survey monuments along what they took to be the 45th parallel of north latitude, intended to be the boundary between New York and Quebec. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842 said that their measurement errors stand, so the boundary between Vermont and Quebec, and between New York and Quebec, is where Collins and Valentine put the survey monumnets, some of which still stand today (see Collins–Valentine line).

Royer designed the jail; the brick building features limestone trim, a hip roof with gabled dormers, and a front porch which was rebuilt in 1997. The building also included the county sheriff's residence, an arrangement which allowed for the sheriff to continuously watch the prisoners. The jail housed prisoners until 1990, when a new jail was constructed after the State of Illinois condemned the old building. The Franklin County Historic Preservation Society has since converted the old jail to a historic museum.[2]

In 2005, the school was placed on Warning Status for Accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), so a new Franklin High School was constructed on what was once the old high school's athletic fields. It was first open to the public about 2 weeks before the first day of school (September 3, 2014). They demolished the old FHS and the next year completed the athletic fields.[3]

Resisting the empiricism of his day, he denounced most Western philosophy since Descartes as trending into atheism and has been considered a revival of the Scholastic school. He was one of the most influential theologians of his age but his influence on subsequent philosophy has been less marked. Today he is thought to have re-introduced theological engagement with Meister Eckhart into academia and even Christianity and Theosophy more generally.[1]

The possessions of the abbey rapidly increased, 50 years after its foundation the abbey's territory reached the coast. The woods were cleared, and numerous villages of the Hagenhufendorf type were set up and populated with German settlers. In 1325, the last prince of Rügen died without an issue, and Neuenkamp with the rest of the principality was inherited by the dukes of Pomerania. The abbey prospered until it was secularized in 1535, following the Protestant Reformation and the adaoption of Lutheranism by the Pomeranian nobility in 1534.[2]

      <p id="GL184_349_002" num_links="2">Arriving as one of the first Spanish (and European) settlers in the Americas, Las Casas initially participated in, but eventually felt compelled to oppose the abuses committed by colonists against the Native Americans.[3] As a result, in 1515 he gave up his Indian slaves and encomienda, and advocated, before King Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, on behalf of rights for the natives. In his early writings, he advocated the use of African slaves instead of Natives in the West Indian colonies but did so without knowing that the Portuguese were carrying out "brutal and unjust wars in the name of spreading the faith".[4] Later in life, he retracted this position, as he regarded both forms of slavery as equally wrong.[5] In 1522, he tried to launch a new kind of peaceful colonialism on the coast of <link wikipedia="Venezuela" osm="424311890 272644" type="node relation">Venezuela</link>, but this venture failed. Las Casas entered the Dominican Order and became a friar, leaving public life for a decade. He traveled to Central America, acting as a missionary among the Maya of <link wikipedia="Guatemala" osm="1644732479 1521463" type="node relation">Guatemala</link> and participating in debates among colonial churchmen about how best to bring the natives to the Christian faith.

In 1785, Frederick Augustus joined the Prussian-sponsored Fürstenbund (League of Princes), but remained neutral during the Austro-Prussian dispute in 1790. Offered the Polish crown in 1791, he declined as he feared that his "risky" politics may cause further damage to the Polish state, which was already weak and eventually stopped existing in 1795. The next year <link wikipedia="Saxony" osm="62467" type="relation">Saxony</link> reluctantly joined the coalition against Revolutionary France but was defeated by 1796. Again entering the struggle on Prussia's side in 1806, after the decisive defeat at Jena in the same year, Frederick Augustus made peace with Napoleon, which secured the title of king of Saxony for him. A year later, Napoleon secured the Duchy of Warsaw for him. Frederick Augustus remained a loyal ally to <link wikipedia="France" osm="11980 2202162" type="relation relation">France</link> even after the disastrous Russian campaign (1812–13).

The special aspect of the tunnel is that anyone is permitted to decorate its walls, ceiling, and floor. The tunnel connects NCSU's North Campus with the Central Campus and provides the most direct route from The Brickyard to the Central Campus residence halls. Clubs, fraternities, sororities, and other organizations often paint the tunnel to promote events and amateur artists paint to express themselves and to promote freedom of speech. A retaining wall just outside the tunnel's south entrance is also open for free expression. The "service tunnel" itself was constructed in 1939 as a Public Works Administration project. The tunnel was first painted in 1968, when it was painted red and white to celebrate the military veterans of North Carolina
