Hence, though its name is found in Strabo, Pliny, and the Itineraries, it is not noticed by Rutilius in his description of the coast of Etruria, and no ruins now mark the site. But the distances given in the Itinerary of 9 M.P. from Alsium, and the same from Portus Augusti at the mouth of the Tiber, enable us to fix its position with certainty at a spot now called Fregene in the comune of <link wikipedia="Fiumicino" osm="72962224 41575" type="node relation">Fiumicino</link>.[8]

The Albertsbahn (Albert’s Railway) was built with the aim of transporting  hard coal mined in the  Döhlen Basin (Döhlener Becken) to Dresden more quickly. Potschappel was an important location for the Saxon coal industry, so the opening of a railway station proved to be a good idea. A year later, on 1 December 1856, the Niederhermsdorfer Kohlezweigbahn (Niederhermsdorf coal branch railway) was opened to connect with the coal fields of the Königliche Steinkohlenwerk Zauckerode (Royal Zauckerode colliery). It branched off at Potschappel station in the area of the Dresden Porcelain factory (Sächsische Porzellanmanufaktur Dresden), crossed the street of Roßthalerstrasse (now Carl-Thieme-Strasse) and followed the course of <link wikipedia="Wiederitz" osm="9081499" type="relation">Wiederitz</link> to the village of <link wikipedia="Wurgwitz" osm="278396390" type="node">Niederhermsdorf</link>.

It was initially used for convicts transported from Britain, but was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage.

      <p id="GL185_300_001" num_links="4">Fresh Pond is a 62-acre (250,000 m2) pond in the <link wikipedia="Manomet,_Massachusetts" osm="158854434" type="node">Manomet</link> section of <link wikipedia="Plymouth,_Massachusetts" osm="158863084 2387531" type="node relation">Plymouth, Massachusetts</link>. The average depth is 12 feet (3.7 m) and the maximum depth is 30 feet (9.1 m). The southern shore of the pond is located in the Churchill Landing neighborhood, south of Manomet's business district and Manomet Bluffs, west of Fisherman's Landing, north of Cedar Bushes and <link wikipedia="Shallow_Pond_(Plymouth,_Massachusetts)" osm="236933311" type="way">Shallow Pond</link>, and east of <link wikipedia="Beaver_Dam_Pond_(Plymouth,_Massachusetts)" osm="236933329" type="way">Beaver Dam Pond</link>. Route 3A runs along the southeastern shore of the pond to its most southeastern point where it shoots away at a sharp curve known as the Brown Bear Curve, named after a defunct motel along the shore at that curve. A public beach, boat ramp, and a Native American burial site are located on the western shore of the pond on Bartlett Road, which has two intersections with Route 3A. The closer intersection is south of the Brown Bear Curve, while the other intersection is one mile (1.6 km) north, north of Manomet's business district. The pond is hydrologically associated with a cranberry bog operation located to the west of the pond. An unnamed brook (locally called "Hell's River" by some) heads west through the cranberry bog and ultimately leading to Beaver Dam Brook is the outflow of the pond.

He is perhaps better known for inventing the catadioptric (reflective/refractive) Fresnel lens and for pioneering the use of "stepped" lenses to extend the visibility of <link wikipedia="Lighthouse" osm="4635881655" type="node">lighthouses</link>, saving countless lives at sea.

After changes and fragmentation of local government (1590/92 to 1685 Schaffelitzky of Mukkadell) in 1685 the town was solely owned by the Duke of Württemberg - Frederick Charles but soon sold again, to Baron Johann Gottlob von Zobel of Giebelstadt heir owner of the place. His heirs in turn sold the town in 1727 at the Landeshofmeisterin Wilhelmine of Würben. Around 1731–1733 Duke Eberhard Louis, acquired the town. The town was not incorporated into the Duchy of Württemberg, but protected as 'Hofkammergut' in the Württemberg 'Kameralverwaltung'. When the Württemberg Oberamt Besigheim was dissolved in 1938, Freudental came within the district of Ludwigsburg, where it remains.

      <p id="GL185_441_002" num_links="2">While some buildings date from the American Revolutionary War era, the village name was a result of the "Schuylkill Navigation" canal. The canal required construction, in the early 1820s, of a set of locks at that point along the <link wikipedia="Schuylkill_River" osm="4264719" type="relation">Schuylkill River</link>.  Locks #54 and #55[3] were built on farmland acquired from John Frick and the village became known as Frick's Locks.  The village thrived due to the economic stimulus of the canal. Eventually the commercial canal traffic declined toward the turn of the century and gave way to the railroad. Frick's Locks had become the singular Frick's Lock after the <link wikipedia="Schuylkill_Branch" osm="1402611" type="relation">Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroad</link> arrived and built a station with the latter name. The canal was filled in starting in 1942.  While the railroad eventually declined after Conrail was formed on April 1, 1976, the village remained inhabited until near the end of the 20th century.
