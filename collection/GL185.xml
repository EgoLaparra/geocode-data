The upper basin of the Ewaso Ng'iro River is 15,200-square-kilometre (5,900 sq mi).[2] The river has a continuous water supply due to the glaciers on <link wikipedia="Mount_Kenya" osm="294560693" type="node">Mount Kenya</link>. Ewaso Ng'iro feeds into Lake Ol Bolossat, the only lake in Nyandarua county and the larger Central Kenya.[3][4][5] Ewaso Ng'iro crosses seven arid to semi-arid landscapes.  It is characterized by vastly different physiographic features and species and has become a fundamental component to the survival of the wildlife, as well as the expansion of human population and socio-economic developments. Water, the limited land resource provided by the Ewaso Ng’iro watershed is unevenly distributed throughout the higher and lower regions of the catchment due to the large percentage necessary to maintain agricultural practices and climatic changes (Mutiga, Su, and Woldai 3).

There is also an upper level of retail and food court facilities accessed from the middle level. Transit between levels is via a series of lifts, stairs and escalators within the Mall; in addition, some stores trade from two or more levels of the mall.

The current goal of the system is to connect the neighborhood of <link wikipedia="Sacomã" osm="2162062" type="relation">Sacomã</link> to Parque Dom Pedro II, in order to integrate with other forms of transportation for the residents of the extreme eastern part of the city, mainly <link wikipedia="Cidade_Tiradentes_(district_of_São_Paulo)" osm="1936083395 3049440" type="node relation">Cidade Tiradentes</link>.

On April 28, 2009, Mayor Gilberto Kassab and Governor José Serra announced an agreement to amend the project, now to be called Metrô Leve Expresso Tiradentes.  The project cost is estimated at R$ 2.3 billion and is estimated to be completed (between Vila Prudente and Tiradentes ) in 2012.
For almost ten years, the BRT project of São Paulo has been postponed, and as a result, its original design has changed so that the current Expresso Tiradentes has lost virtually all the characteristics of a true BRT.  An agreement between the Mayor of São Paulo and the Governor declared that the stretch between Vila Prudente and Tiradentes would be a monorail system.[1]

Built on the site of an earlier Anglo-Saxon stone burh, the castle was constructed by William de Enysford, probably between 1085 and 1087, to protect the lands of Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, from Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux. It comprised an inner and an outer bailey, the former protected by a stone curtain wall. In 1130 the defences were improved, and a large stone hall built in the inner bailey. The de Enysford family held the castle until their male line died out in 1261, when it was divided equally between the Heringaud and de Criol families. A royal judge, William Inge, purchased half of the castle in 1307, and arguments ensued between him and his co-owner, Nicholas de Criol, who ransacked Eynsford in 1312. The castle was never reoccupied and fell into ruins, and in the 18th century it was used to hold hunting kennels and stables. The ruins began to be restored after 1897, work intensifying after 1948 when the Ministry of Works took over the running of the castle. In the 21st century, Eynsford Castle is managed by English Heritage and is open to visitors.
