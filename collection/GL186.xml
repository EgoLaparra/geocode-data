Facing well-established competition, Fairfield Inn needed a strategy to differentiate itself from its competitors. Management implemented Scorecord terminals to allow guests to rate the hotels as either 'excellent', 'average', or poor'. Marriott was then able to track important metrics and provide superior customer service. Additionally, Fairfield Inn placed a heavy emphasis on quality personnel selection to find friendly and positive staff that would also help reduce turnover. This was supported by providing higher wages than competitors (at the time being in the top 25% of wages within the lodging industry).[3]

The Brockway Tavern building, located on the northwest corner of West Genesee and Onondaga, formerly housed a tavern, motor inn, restaurants and later a funeral home, and now houses a credit union. The house was built c. 1808 and survives as one of the oldest structures in the hamlet.

      <p id="GL186_494_002" num_links="5">The castle may have been built around 1200[1] on a steep eminence at the lower entrance to the Höllental, also known as the Falkensteige, by a Zähringen ministerialis family. Its founders probably came from the <link wikipedia="Stegen" osm="240109520 74462" type="node relation">Wittental</link> valley from the lords of Weiler and Blankenberg[2] and are first recorded from 1137 to 1148 as the lords of Falkenstein.[3]  In the ensuing period they rose to become one of the circle of important aristocratic families in the Breisgau. The valley was named Falkensteiner Tal after them and their castle, and only changed to Höllental later on. The castle was supposed to guard the important communication route through the valley which linked the Breisgau to the Baar region and <link wikipedia="Lake_Constance" osm="1156846" type="relation">Lake Constance</link>. The lords of the castle soon reigned over an area that extended up the valley to <link wikipedia="Hinterzarten" osm="240119819 317596" type="node relation">Hinterzarten</link> and <link wikipedia="Titisee-Neustadt" osm="2485596983 6318355186 319155" type="node node relation">Titisee</link>.
