Farmington was the site of an early Christian Church, founded by 1845 pioneers in Sarah and Philip Harris, who arrived in Oregon via the Meek Cutoff.[3][4] At that time the locale was called "Bridgeport".[3] Baptisms were in the Tualatin River.[3]

      <p id="GL188_139_002" num_links="3">The atoll was named in honor of Robert Townsend Farquhar in 1824.[1] Previous visitors had named it after Portuguese explorer João da Nova who commanded that nation’s third expedition to India during which he encountered Farquhar (in the year 1504). Administration of the atoll was a grey area for many years, with both <link wikipedia="Mauritius" osm="1708980402 535828 1569926" type="node relation relation">Mauritius</link> and <link wikipedia="Seychelles" osm="424298277 536765" type="node relation">Seychelles</link> claiming the right to administer it. In 1881 the authorities in Seychelles suggested Farquhar, along with several other outer islands, be administered from Victoria in Seychelles rather than from Mauritius. There were objections as the owners were based in Mauritius but after considerable argument, the owners lost their case and administration was passed from Mauritius to Seychelles.
Fishing camps were established on north islands in 1850 [2]
In 1960, the village on the northern tip of South Island was abandoned.[3]
From 1965 to the independence of the Seychelles in 1976, Farquhar was a part of the <link wikipedia="British_Indian_Ocean_Territory" osm="424313891 1993867" type="node relation">British Indian Ocean Territory</link>.[4]
In 2004 there were renovations in the village.[5]
In 2014 Island Conservation Society opened a Conservation Centre on North Island.[6][7] On 16 April 2016 Farquhar Atoll was hit by Cyclone Fantala, the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the south-west Indian Ocean, which destroyed most of the buildings except for the cyclone shelter. The Islands Development Company (IDC) has started the rehabilitation of the island and to date has rebuilt the guest house which offers catch and release flyfishing trips that are operated by Alphonse Fishing Company.

That region of Texas had been controlled by the Comanche from about 1725, when the they defeated the Apache and forced them to migrate to the Rockies in New Mexico and to other regions. The Red River War of 1874-1875—the biggest military operation the U.S. had between the Civil War and World War One—saw five armies converge on that part of the High Plains, ultimately defeating the main Comanche force in Palo Duro Canyon (80 miles northeast of Farwell) by driving off and slaughtering the Comanches' horses.

The castle could only be reached by a drawbridge over a narrow ravine, protected by a barbican. Little remains today of the keep or the courtyard walls except foundations, and a section of the north-east wall.[2] The layout of the castle is very similar to that of <link wikipedia="Dunnottar_Castle" osm="504422636" type="way">Dunnottar Castle</link> in <link wikipedia="Aberdeenshire" osm="1900655" type="relation">Aberdeenshire</link>, though Fast Castle is on a smaller scale.

Its inhabitants are nicknamed the "Turks" by the neighbouring towns and villages.  It is believed that the inhabitants refused to join the crusades against the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, and were called as Turks consequently. Another (more likely) reason could be that the inhabitants did not have to pay the taxes collected by the monks of the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy for the war against the Turkish empire, since Faymonville was part of the Duchy of Luxembourg, contrary to the other Walloon villages of the area.  The inhabitants of these villages therefore would have called the inhabitants of Faymonville the "Turks".  To protest, the latter adopted crescent and star as their symbols wearing them and dressing their building. This later became a tradition.  It was even once told that when the villagers were to gather in the church, they did not use the bells but a call to church like the call to prayer in Turkey.  This has however never been really assessed and should be viewed more as a legend.  Every year the town celebrates their connection to Turks and the inhabitants now call themselves Turks.
