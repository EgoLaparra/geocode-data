Built by the main Swedish film producer at the time, Svensk Filmindustri, in 1919–1920, Filmstaden was one of the most modern film studios in Europe. Some 400 movies have been created at Filmstaden. The first movie to be filmed at Filmstaden was The Phantom Carriage by director Victor Sjöström. Practically all Swedish actors and film directors of the 20th century had some connection with Filmstaden. In 1969, Svensk Filminstustri finally left Filmstaden, and the studios were used by small film producers, production of television dramas and the Riksteatern Theatre. One of the last major films to partly have been filmed at Filmstaden was The Emigrants. Most of the buildings were quite well preserved until the beginning of the 21st century when Filmstaden had to make way for a housing development. Some buildings, however, have been renovated and Svensk Filmindustri has moved its headquarters back to a former studio building.

The Gaelic name of the village was recorded[when?] by Diack[clarification needed] using his own transcription method as fanna-guchti, which is of unclear meaning. One of the earliest references to Findochty is in 1440, when the king granted Findachtifeild to John Dufe, son of John Dufe. The lands passed from the Duffs to the Ogilvies of Findlater, and subsequently, in 1568, the Ord family acquired the manor, port, custom, and fishers' lands of Findochty, and later built the House of Findochty, known as Findochty Castle, now a ruin, which stands to the west of the village. In 1716 the Ords brought 13 men and 4 boys from Fraserburgh under contract to fish from Findochty, and for a time the harbour was busy with landings of herring and white fish. Findochty expanded as a fishing port through the 1700s and 1800s, and by 1850 was home to 140 fishing boats. But the expansion in the late 1800s of nearby <link wikipedia="Buckie" osm="31818758" type="node">Buckie</link> provided a better harbour, and some of the fishing fleet had left Findochty by 1890. Findochty harbour is now used mostly by pleasure craft and is a good sun spot when the tide is out. A local artist, Correna Cowie, created a statue in 1959 of a seated fisherman, known as The Mannie, who watches over the harbour.

The two granite columns at the main entrance, 3 feet 8 inches (1.12 m) in diameter and 12 feet 10 inches (3.91 m) high, were said to be the largest polished monolithic shafts in the country.[3] The interior features Art Nouveau motifs and murals by artists such as Martha Susan Baker, Frederic Clay Bartlett, Oliver Dennett Grover, Frank Xavier Leyendecker, and Bertha Sophia Menzler-Peyton dating from the 1898 renovation.

Local furnaces produced pig iron and later the quarries supplied ore for the steel works at Corby. A disused quarry face in the south of the parish is a geological SSSI.

The FMOM hosts fire departments both nationally and internationally in their quest to emulate their success.  Working with the University of Memphis to validate their Fire Prevention Public Education Curriculum, the Fire Museum of Memphis is the first of its kind to capture data, testing their Fire Prevention effectiveness.  Local schools are offered free admission with bus transportation reimbursement, drastically impacting a fire fatality rate that was two and one half times the national average when the museum opened in October, 1998.

The church was forced to move to Noddle's Island. The church was forced to be disguised as a tavern and members traveled by water to worship. Rev.

Dr. Rollin Heber Neale, the church briefly joined with the Shawmut Ave. Church, and the Warren Avenue Tabernacle, and merged and bought the current church in 1881, for $100,000.00[citation needed].

The site was the last of corners of King and Bay to be redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, and a major bidding war began over the property. The then little known firm of Olympia and York eventually obtained nearly the whole city block, though the election of reformist mayor David Crombie led to new rules banning skyscrapers and it took three years of lobbying before permission for First Canadian Place was granted.
