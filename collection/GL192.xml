The First National Bank operated from February 1920 to June 14, 1923, when it went into receivership as the oil boom collapsed and its vice president was convicted of embezzlement.

In 1936 the county sold the building to the town. It became a civic center for the town, operating a post office until the 1950s. A doctor's office had occupied the rear in the 1920s, and in the 1940s apartments were built, which later became the town's jail. With the departure of the post office the building became a fire station. From 1935 to 1985 the Council Room was used by civic organizations. From 1940 to 1985 another room was the town library.[2]

It was moved, along with a manse built in 1824, in 1920 to the present location at 89-60 164th Street. Two years later, a bronze tablet was erected to mark the 260th anniversary.[4] In 1925, a church house, now known as the Magill Memorial Building, was erected to accommodate the growing church's need for office and classroom space.[3] In 1959, Donald Trump was confirmed here and attended services in his formative years within a then all-white congregation.[5] In April 2008, the church celebrated its 345th anniversary.[1] Later that year, the church turned down landmark recognition by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.[6]

Upon his return to <link wikipedia="New_England" osm="9660059" type="relation">New England</link>, John Pierpont proclaimed to his compatriots the attractive features of Cincinnati, and within two years a Unitarian congregation was founded in the city.  Located at the intersection of Fourth and Race Streets <link wikipedia="Downtown_Cincinnati" osm="9966947" type="relation">downtown</link>, their first church building was dedicated on May 23, 1830;[2]:348 it was later replaced by a building at the nearby intersection of Eighth and Plum Streets.[2]:351  In its first year, the church was led by a succession of young ministers; although these early pastors were among the most prominent of the denomination's young ministers, many of these men typically left the pastorate at unusually young ages due to failing health.  As a result, the congregation was frequently left without a preacher and forced to look to New England for new ministers.  Among these men was William Henry Channing, who served the congregation from 1839 to 1844.[2]:348  Following Channing was the former lawyer James H. Perkins, who drowned in 1849; during his five years of ministry, he engaged the congregation in a range of social justice purposes, such as prison reforms and welfare for the poor.[2]:349  Controversy arose in the 1850s: questions of abolitionism were tense in a city located so close to the slave state of <link wikipedia="Kentucky" osm="316959037 161655" type="node relation">Kentucky</link>, and theological differences over the existence of miracles caused the church to split into two.  These tensions were resolved in the 1870s: both congregations had come to reject the existence of miracles, and the Thirteenth Amendment had ended slavery throughout the United States.[2]:350  Under the ministry of George Thayer, which began in 1882, the congregation was faced with widespread movement of members from downtown to the city's northern edges; as a result, the present building was erected along <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_42" osm="168032" type="relation">Reading Road</link>, 2 miles (3.2 km) northeast of the former site.[2]:351

Characterized by its dual cubic volumes, stone foundation and detailed cypress cladding, the Fisher house stands as a clear statement of how Kahn was working at the time, and how his work differed from that of his contemporaries. In the Fisher House, Kahn eschews the linearity of the modern plan and focuses on a simple geometry, allowing the cubes to provide a separation of public and private space. Known widely for monumental works like the <link wikipedia="Salk_Institute_for_Biological_Studies" osm="31839360 31842306 31844209 31844744" type="way way way way">Salk Institute</link> and the Richards Medical Center, the Fisher house stands as a testament to Kahn’s ability to work with the details of small residential architecture. The Fisher House stands as the clearest example of Kahn's unique architectural style at the time, his use of the two almost perfect cubes differing greatly from much of what was being done at the time and setting him apart in his own field of design.

The area became more commercial in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to the opening of railroad tracks and the discovery of a mineral water well. Visitors came for the therapeutic value of the mineral water, but when the well went dry in 1914 the area began its reversion to being a primarily residential area. Fisherville is also home of one of Louisville's great Basketball coaches, Denny Crum, who coached for the University of Louisville for 30 years attaining 2 Men's Basketball Championships.

The Fiskeville textile mill was formed by Dr. Caleb Fiske, a Revolutionary War doctor turned businessman in 1812.[3] The village became home to those who worked in the mill, mostly immigrants from Portugal, France, Italy and England.[4] Fiskeville is usually associated with Cranston rather than with Scituate as most of the original buildings including Dr. Fiske's residence were in Cranston. Although the mill and about a dozen nearby mill houses were in Scituate. Poets Karen Haskell and Darcie Dennigan both grew up, a few doors down from each other, in the 1970s and 1980s on Main Street in Fiskeville. [5]

Located at the entrance to New Haven Harbor, the beacon's name derives from its proximity to <link wikipedia="Downtown_New_Haven" osm="2383763234" type="node">Downtown New Haven</link>, about five miles (8 km) away.  The original lighthouse consisted of a 30-foot (9.1 m) octagonal wooden tower built in 1805 by Abisha Woodward. In 1847, a new 80-foot (24 m) octagonal tower was constructed by Marcus Bassett with East Haven brownstone.  This new beacon was illuminated by 12 lamps with reflectors which were positioned 97 feet (30 m) above sea level. Also constructed at this time was a two-and-one-half story brick house which supplanted the previous, deteriorating keeper's dwelling.  A fourth-order Fresnel lens replaced the lamps in 1855 and a fog bell was added in the 1860s. The Five Mile Point Light was deactivated in 1877 when the nearby <link wikipedia="Southwest_Ledge_Light" osm="497739101" type="node">Southwest Ledge Light</link> was completed.  Currently, the lighthouse is contained within <link wikipedia="Lighthouse_Point_Park" osm="43398000" type="way">Lighthouse Point Park</link> and, along with the keeper's house, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

It is part of the S.O.G. series (Geometric Oniroscopic Sculpture). Danonaselo is a very specific proper name given by San Damon to this sculpture. All the difficulty comes from the fact that Damon had to move from 2D drawing to 3D sculpture with the particular twists and angles that emerge from the strange character. Indeed, the night lighting surrounding the Danonaselo and the daylight that illuminates it, and in particular the presence of the sun that revolves around it, makes us see a totally different character. Shadows are thrown to the ground and angles are projected on the facades. The Danonaselo is placed for life in a public square in Portugal, in Fiães in the entity of Santa Maria da Feira and is part of the Portuguese heritage. The work is three metres high and looks out, as San Damon wanted, towards the ocean through the lands of Mozelos, <link wikipedia="Lourosa_(Santa_Maria_da_Feira)" osm="2920823935 6022193" type="node relation">Lourosa</link>, <link wikipedia="São_Paio_de_Oleiros" osm="4037561009 6022202" type="node relation">São Paio de Oleiros</link>, etc. The roundabout on which the Danonaselo is placed is decorated with certain flowers in harmony with the work.

A flag was raised by the local farmer when a steamer passed to alert the port authorities in the settlement 7 km further south.

Located near Manukau Heights the council has planned for the area to undergo substantial development since buying 290 hectares there in 1996.[1] While most of Flat Bush is being developed by the private sector, Auckland Council is guiding the overall development of the area to ensure people, places and the environment are given emphasis.
The suburb contains the 94 hectare "Barry Curtis Park", named in recognition of Manukau's longest standing mayor, Barry Curtis,[2] with a development programme stretching into the 2020s.[3] A neighbouring 20 hectare town centre will be developed starting in 2010,[4] and planning is underway for subdivision of another 440 hectares. Building of houses has started next to Barry Curtis Park as of 2012. More land in the area is going to be developed over the next few years by Todd Property Group.
