The house was originally built as a single two story cell structure with a large chimney on one side, which was then widened with the addition of a second cell on the other side of the chimney.  In the 19th century a number of alterations were made: the central chimney was removed, the entry of the house was reoriented from south to north by the addition of a new central door on the north face, and two new chimneys were added along the north elevation.  The house has modern additions to the rear (south) side.  The barn is of a similar vintage to the house, although it started with only five windows, and was extended at some point by the addition to the east of a sixth bay.  It is one of a very few surviving First Period barns.[2]

This work, updated in 1874, gave a historical assessment of the decline of earlier societies because of a lack of stewardship, and made substantive calls for remedial actions to preserve the natural environment.

Development began in the district soon after the town was founded in 1818; there are five homes remaining from the antebellum period.  The district saw moderate growth between the Civil War and the early 1900s, most of which are Queen Anne and Victorian styles.  The majority of houses in the district were constructed between 1908 and 1939.  As the need for housing in the town grew, larger antebellum lots were subdivided and new construction was added.  Larger houses tended to be American Foursquares, while middle-class houses were bungalows and cottages, some with Tudor Revival and Colonial Revival details.  The district is entirely residential, with the exception of the First Methodist Church, built in 1925 in Neoclassical style; 400 North Jefferson was built in 1935 as a <link wikipedia="Hospital" osm="6720868760 396954377 648783951" type="node way way">hospital</link>, but later converted to apartments.

Though not directly involved in King Philip's War, the village nonetheless did become a victim of Indian raids.  The village, which became known as New Rowley, grew for many years, with small mills and eventually a shoe company opening up in the town.  By 1838, the town was sufficiently large enough for its own incorporation, and was renamed Georgetown. Small industry continued, and today the town is mostly residential in nature, a distant suburb of Boston's North Shore.[2] from 1972 to 1977 there was a stray dog problem that required the attention of the state police, in the 5 years 14 people were attacked while unattended.

Regular performances at the theatre continued until 1830, when performances became less frequent and in 1848 it was let as an auction house. The Georgian Theatre Royal was reopened by a non-profit trust in 1963, it was expanded in 1996 and had major restoration works, including the addition of a museum, costing £1.6 million in 2002, reopening once again in 2003.[3]
August 2016 saw the opening of The Georgian Theatre Royal Experience, a small but perfectly formed museum, detailing the history of the theatre and displaying artefacts from the theatre's collection, as well as The Woodland Scene, reported to be the oldest surviving stage scenery in the world. In addition, the Paul Iles Learning Centre was reopened following extensive renovation, and now houses The Georgian Theatre Royal Youth Theatre as well as many events including volunteer open days, book groups and costume making sessions.

      <p id="GL195_294_001" num_links="2">Gerard Manley Hopkins SJ (28 July 1844 – 8 June 1889) was an English poet and Jesuit priest, whose posthumous fame established him among the leading Victorian poets. His manipulation of prosody – particularly his concept of sprung rhythm and use of imagery – established him as an innovative writer of verse. Two of his major themes were nature and religion. Only after his death did Robert Bridges begin to publish a few of Hopkins's mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare the way for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 his work was recognized as being among the most original literary accomplishments of his century. It had a marked influence on such leading 20th-century poets as T. S. Eliot, <link wikipedia="Dylan_Thomas" osm="518358901" type="way">Dylan Thomas</link>, <link wikipedia="W._H._Auden" osm="656174374" type="node">W. H. Auden</link>, Stephen Spender and C. Day Lewis.

His grandfather was the physician John Simm Smith, a university colleague of John Keats, and close friend of the eccentric philanthropist Ann Thwaytes.

The first German Fest was held in August 1981.[3] It is billed as the "Largest German celebration in North America"[4] and "A Milwaukee Tradition".[2] It currently occurs during the last full weekend in July.[5]  As of 1993, Milwaukee had a 52% German population, which is the largest European percentage in a major U.S. metropolitan area.[1]
