It was created to take care of Europeans patients only, since it was based on the colonialist ideology of that time which was highly segregationist. 
It was first named "Nachtigal Hospital", on behalf of the roving  Consul Nachtigal. Doctor Gustav Nachtigal was in charge of representing <link wikipedia="William_I,_German_Emperor" osm="4057846973" type="node">Emperor of Germany William I</link> and the <link wikipedia="Otto_von_Bismarck" osm="1716973413 4519251681" type="node node">Chancellor Bismarck</link> all over the <link wikipedia="Gulf_of_Guinea" osm="305640297" type="node">gulf of Guinea</link>.

Finally, Nachtigal's remarkable career ended with the official installation of Julius von Soden as the first German Governor, from 1885 to 1891, long before the construction of the hospital.

      <p id="GL196_108_002" num_links="4">The first historically documented evidence of Fornaci goes back to approximately 1000AD. The ancient village took the name of Caterozzo, today just the name of one of the four districts of Fornaci. Probably the name comes from “cala” meaning water and “tur” meaning passage, which joined together means ford, describing the original swampy territory on which the first village rose, frequently flooded by the <link wikipedia="Serchio" osm="2146938" type="relation">Serchio</link> river. The population was constituted from farmers, fishermen and breeders of cattle who traded their products with the Versiliesi (traders from Versilia, the coastal region of <link wikipedia="Tuscany" osm="1781917334 41977" type="node relation">Tuscany</link>) in exchange for spices. A war between the citizens of <link wikipedia="Lucca" osm="1822616932 42659" type="node relation">Lucca</link> and Pope Gregory IX (1230) caused the exodus of the population of Caterozzo and some of the nearby villages to the Apennine mountains. The activity of the "Caterozzo’s Furnaces" which took advantage of the rich deposits of clay, increased in the first half of the 15th century. The village was increasingly becoming, around the various brick-kilns, what would be the centre of today’s Fornaci vecchia. Ancient documents mention the castle of Catarozzo, a sign that the village was protected by castle walls, no trace of which remain today .[1] Thanks to the "Furnaces of Caterozzo" families the pieve of Loppia, of which only the perimeter walls, the facade and the apse remained, was reconstructed and in 1522 was reopened to the faithful. As the village evolved its name changed to become the present one. Of the ancient brick-kilns only one survives to the present day, completely restored and transformed into a shopping centre. The main expansion of the village happened, however, during the first world war thanks to the building, in 1915, of a branch of Societa’ Metallurgica Italiana belonging to the Orlando Group, an ammunition factory that provided jobs to thousands of people. As a consequence many new houses had to be built for the workers, which resulted in the Fornaci of the present day.[2] Today the factory has lost a large part of its original purpose and has become specialized in the working of copper and its alloys. In the first years of the present century, with the advent of the euro, the factory, today called KME Group, started to produce coins. Consequently the village is now called “Fornaci, the village where the euro is born”. These days the village has become enriched by many shops and has become the commercial centre of the <link wikipedia="Serchio" osm="2146938" type="relation">Serchio</link> valley and its Garfagnana neighbour.[3]

It later became part of the lands of the college of canons of <link wikipedia="Amsoldingen_Castle" osm="259376131" type="way">Amsoldingen</link>.

It was then sold and passed through a number of owners.  In 1541 the land and Zwing und Bann rights over Forst were half owned by the farmers of the village.  By the 18th century about two-thirds of the sparsely settled community were in the court of Gurzelen which was part of the Herrschaft of Burgistein.  The other third was in the court of Amsoldingen which was part of the Thun District.  Following the 1798 French invasion, Forst became part of the Helvetic Republic district of Oberseftigen.  After the collapse of the Republic and the 1803 Act of Mediation both parts of the community were combined and joined the newly created Thun District.  In the 20th century it formed a school district with Längenbühl and developed close relationships with the nearby municipality.  In 2007 the two municipalities merged into a single entity.[4]

In 2006 it reopened to tourists as the Museum of the Alps, it has additional art exhibitions and galleries. In the summer, the main courtyard is used to host musical and theatrical performances.

</p>
      <p id="GL196_234_002" num_links="5">The fort, which is at the entrance to the Aosta Valley, is located in a narrow gorge above the <link wikipedia="Dora_Baltea" osm="185434291 2146996" type="way relation">Dora Baltea</link> river. It has been used for millennia to control the historic route between Italy and France. The current fortifications were built by Charles Albert of Savoy between 1830 and 1838. It replaced a 10th-century castle that had, itself, been built on an earlier structure founded by Theodoric I in the 5th century. The castle was under the control of the powerful local lords of Bard until the middle of the 13th century when ownership passed to the House of Savoy. Under their control, the defences were strengthened and improved. On May 14, 1800, a 40,000-strong French army was stopped by 400 Austro-Piedmontese soldiers at Fort Bard. They held the pass for two weeks, completely ruining <link wikipedia="Napoleon" osm="1929326309 3442691028" type="node node">Napoleon Bonaparte</link>'s plan of making a surprise attack on the <link wikipedia="Po_Valley" osm="4863784421" type="node">Po Valley</link> and <link wikipedia="Turin" osm="63621589 43992" type="node relation">Turin</link>. When he heard the news, he named the fort vilain castel de Bard. Bonaparte then ordered the fort to be razed to the ground. It was not until 1830 that Charles Albert of Savoy, fearing new attacks from the French, ordered that the fort be rebuilt. The task was entrusted to the famed Italian military engineer, Francesco Antonio Olivero.
The work, which took eight years to complete, created a fort with two distinct levels. The upper part had conventional battlements whereas the lower part had 50 gun ports in autonomous <link wikipedia="Casemate" osm="7548128" type="relation">casemates</link> that were designed to offer mutual protection if attacked. A total of 416 soldiers could now be billeted in the 283-room fort. The upper level had a courtyard which contained the arsenals and barracks. The fort had enough ammunition and food supplies for three months. By the end of the 19th century, the fort had lost its military value and fell into disuse. However, the Italian Army did continue to use the fort as a powder magazine. When it closed in 1975, ownership passed to the government of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta. In the 1980s the fort opened as a tourist attraction despite many buildings needing urgent repair.
