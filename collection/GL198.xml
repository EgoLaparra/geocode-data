The trail through the valley, which developed into a wagon road whose roadgrade is largely used by today's road through the valley, climbs a steep grade from its southern end, near Fountainview Farms on the Fraser, and descends relatively gently towards Fountain.  The three lakes in the valley, which give it its official name, are Cinquefoil Lake, Kwotlenemo Lake (aka Fountain Lake), and Chilhil Lake, the three of them collectively being known as the Fountain Lakes""  There are many recreational dwellings and small ranches forming a community in the valley, which is something of a rural "suburb" of Lillooet.

The flight of locks was completed in 1799 and raises the water level 160 ft (50 m) in just 800 yd (740 m). This is one of the steepest rises for a major run in the UK which, combined with the sheer number of locks,  makes it one of the most significant in the country.[2] The run of locks includes a series of embanked ponds,[3] pounds, sluices and weirs to control the water supply, with no set of gates shared between individual locks. It therefore comprises a flight of locks rather than a lock staircase.[4]

The Wolfe family built a tavern along this route circa 1800.[3] As the area became more permanently settled in the early 19th century, the developing village took the name of Foxville from the area's largest landowners, the Fox family.[4] In 1830, Mount Moriah Lutheran Church was organized and erected a stone building on the northern edge of the village. A few years later, the Mount Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church was established in 1836 and constructed a log building approximately one mile south of the village. In the latter half of the 19th century, the village further developed with the establishment of a public school, wagon shop, and general store, operated by Thomas Fox, a third-generation descendant of the original settlers.[5] In 1877, Mount Moriah Lutheran Church was largely rebuilt and Mount Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church erected a new building in 1902.

Why the "L" was dropped from the new town's name is not known. The first church was organized in 1701, the first teacher was hired in 1706, and the first permanent schoolhouse was built in 1716.

An early motte and bailey or ringwork Norman castle was built on the Framlingham site by 1148, but this was destroyed by Henry II of England in the aftermath of the revolt of 1173–4. Its replacement, constructed by Roger Bigod, the Earl of Norfolk, was unusual for the time in having no central keep, but instead using a curtain wall with thirteen mural towers to defend the centre of the castle. Despite this, the castle was successfully taken by King John in 1216 after a short siege. By the end of the 13th century, Framlingham had become a luxurious home, surrounded by extensive parkland used for hunting.
