      <p id="GL198_025_002" num_links="5">The term "Giudicarie", means "judicial districts" and goes back to legal traditions of the Middle Age. Actually the term Judicaria was used during the Lombard domination (6th-8th century) to indicate a certain kind of territorial districts descending from a previous Roman military organization. 
The first reference of this term applied to the territory of Giudicarie has been found in a testament of the Bishop Notecherius of Verona, datable to the year 927, where a Judicaria Summa Laganensis is mentioned. This entity encompassed a much larger territory that was reduced to the current extent of the seven districts (in italian called: "Le Sette Pievi delle Giudicarie") in 1349 after a contract of sale between the Bishop of Trento and Mastino II della Scala. According to this contract, the territories of <link wikipedia="Riva_del_Garda" osm="599751168 46276" type="node relation">Riva</link> and Tenno, <link wikipedia="Ledro" osm="46477" type="relation">Ledro</link>, <link wikipedia="Tignale" osm="745607726 45958" type="node relation">Tignale</link>, <link wikipedia="Arco,_Trentino" osm="46423" type="relation">Arco</link> and the <link wikipedia="Cavedine" osm="46646" type="relation">Cavedine</link> valley was assigned to the Scaliger and ceased to be considered part of Giudicarie.[1] 
The whole territory of Giudicarie was subordinate to the March of Trento since 927 and since 1027 to the Bishopric of Trent.

Formerly a cable railway, the Subway was later electrified, but its two circular tracks were never expanded. The line was originally known as the Glasgow District Subway, but was later renamed Glasgow Subway Railway. It was so called when taken over by the Glasgow Corporation who renamed it the Glasgow Underground in 1936. Despite this rebranding, many Glaswegians continued to refer to the network as "the Subway". In 2003 the name "Subway" was officially readopted by its operator, the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT). A £40,000 study examining the feasibility of an expansion into the city's south side was conducted in 2005 while a further commitment from Labour in 2007 to extend to the East End was also to no avail.[3]

An Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 refers to the Glashagarriff river as having brown trout and freshwater eels, but no salmon angling, nor permit for trout fishing required.[2]

It is not particularly independent, because about 750 metres to the north rises the higher summit of the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel (3,081 m). Formerly the 3,008 spot height on the arête between the two peaks was named as the Gleirscher Rosskogel, and this is still the case on many maps;[2] in which case the present Gleirscher Rosskogel would then be called the Gleirscher Rosskopf. At the top is a small metal summit cross with a plaque inscribed with the present name of the peak and an elevation of 2,950 m.

A major accident at the triangle happened on 26 September 1908, when two trains collided. One car derailed and fell from the viaduct, killing 18 people and injuring 21. Upon another dangerous incident, the single level triangle from 1912 was rebuilt and replaced by the current two-level station. Since then there is no direct rail connection between the two lines at Gleisdreieck, only an intersection.

Gleiszellen's first mention in a historical document dates to 1136, whereas Gleishorbach first appeared in a historical record in 1304. Both sit at the bottom of a small mountain called the Hatzelberg, which overlooks the Rhine valley; Gleiszellen now also occupies a good portion of the slopes of the Hatzelberg, having expanded into what were once fields and vineyards. Gleiszellen and Gleishorbach boast picturesque streets at their centers, with many old timberframe houses. The villages are surrounded by vineyards; on their western side, they border the Pfälzerwald, with its extensive forests and hiking paths.
