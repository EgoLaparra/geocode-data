Hence, though its name is found in Strabo, Pliny, and the Itineraries, it is not noticed by Rutilius in his description of the coast of Etruria, and no ruins now mark the site. But the distances given in the Itinerary of 9 M.P. from Alsium, and the same from Portus Augusti at the mouth of the Tiber, enable us to fix its position with certainty at a spot now called Fregene in the comune of <link wikipedia="Fiumicino" osm="72962224 41575" type="node relation">Fiumicino</link>.[8]

First mentioned 885 in a Carolingian document, the peasant village named Salzburghofen was given to the archbishop of Salzburg by king Louis IV in 908. After the Napoleonic Wars in 1816, the border between Bavaria and Austria was drawn along the rivers <link wikipedia="Saalach" osm="408583" type="relation">Saalach</link> and Salzach, and Salzburghofen became part of Bavaria.

The Albertsbahn (Albert’s Railway) was built with the aim of transporting  hard coal mined in the  Döhlen Basin (Döhlener Becken) to Dresden more quickly. Potschappel was an important location for the Saxon coal industry, so the opening of a railway station proved to be a good idea. A year later, on 1 December 1856, the Niederhermsdorfer Kohlezweigbahn (Niederhermsdorf coal branch railway) was opened to connect with the coal fields of the Königliche Steinkohlenwerk Zauckerode (Royal Zauckerode colliery).

Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage.
