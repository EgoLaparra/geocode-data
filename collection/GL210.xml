      <p id="GL210_276_002" num_links="2">During the Paleoproterozoic era from 2.2 to 1.9 billion years ago, mud and muddy sand accumulated on the bed of a shallow sea.  These sediments compacted into layers of shale and graywacke.  Dubbed the Rove Formation, they are among the oldest unmetamorphosed sedimentary rock on earth.[4]  1.1 billion years ago the North American Plate began to crack in the middle, and lava flowed out of this Midcontinent Rift System creating the distinctive basalt of <link wikipedia="Lake_Superior" osm="4039486" type="relation">Lake Superior</link>'s North Shore (and <link wikipedia="Interstate_Park" osm="6979229" type="relation">Interstate Park</link> to the south).[5]  In what is now Grand Portage State Park, upwelling magma did not reach the surface but intruded into fractures in the Rove Formation, cooling more slowly into diabase rather than basalt.  One set of intrusions formed northeast-to-southwest trending sills while a later event formed northwest-to-southeast trending dikes.[4][6]  Together they are known as the Logan Intrusions after Canadian geologist William Edmond Logan.[4]

The Monahan Post Band raised money in 1930 to build a modest music shell in the park.  Construction was already underway when the park's neighbors objected to the design.  The project was put on hold as the band raised more money and sought a more suitable design.  After President <link wikipedia="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" osm="1610589818" type="node">Franklin D. Roosevelt</link> created the Civil Works Administration (CWA) in 1933, the city applied to have the new music shell included in Sioux City's projects.  Henry L. Kamphoefner, an unknown Sioux City architect at that time, drew up the plans for the structure.[2]  The sculptural plaques on the front of the pavilion were designed by Herschel Elarth.  The CWA approved the project on February 26, 1934 as CWA Project Number 217.  The construction project required 52 tons of reinforcing steel, 4,200 bags of Portland cement, and 300 bags of white cement, and it was completed on October 17, 1934.[2]  Seating was constructed for 5,000 in the natural amphitheater.  The pavilion was built using $47,436 from Federal Relief funds and $3,800 in materials from the city.  It was dedicated in the spring of 1935.  The Monahan Post Band continued to play here until 1948, when they became the Sioux City Municipal Band.  They continue the summer-time tradition.  The music pavilion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.[1]
