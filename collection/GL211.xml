During the Roman empire the area was inhabited by wealthy Roman citizens who wished to benefit from the cleaner air, uncontaminated water and cooler temperatures during the hot summer months. The remains of many ancient Roman villas are to be found in the surroundings. The most impressive being the walls of the "Villa of the Antonini" where the later Roman emperor Antoninus Pius (r. 138–161 AD) was born.

Minot (1885–1950), who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1934 for discovering a cure for pernicious anemia. Minot had a long history of interest in anemia, and performed his groundbreaking research while chief of medical services at Boston's Collis Huntington Memorial Hospital in the 1920s. He continued research on blood-related diseases at the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory of Boston City Hospital until his retirement in 1948. He died in 1950 from complications associated with diabetes mellitus, which afflicted him in 1921 and might have killed him soon thereafter, had insulin not been discovered the following year. Minot was also a full professor at <link wikipedia="Harvard_Medical_School" osm="3061338" type="relation">Harvard Medical School</link>, and was the first American to receive the Moxon Medal from the <link wikipedia="Royal_College_of_Physicians" osm="26709894" type="way">Royal College of Physicians</link>.

Development began in the district soon after the town was founded in 1818; there are five homes remaining from the antebellum period.  The district saw moderate growth between the Civil War and the early 1900s, most of which are Queen Anne and Victorian styles.  The majority of houses in the district were constructed between 1908 and 1939.  As the need for housing in the town grew, larger antebellum lots were subdivided and new construction was added.  Larger houses tended to be American Foursquares, while middle-class houses were bungalows and cottages, some with Tudor Revival and Colonial Revival details.  The district is entirely residential, with the exception of the First Methodist Church, built in 1925 in Neoclassical style; 400 North Jefferson was built in 1935 as a <link wikipedia="Hospital" osm="6720868760 396954377 648783951" type="node way way">hospital</link>, but later converted to apartments.

Though not directly involved in King Philip's War, the village nonetheless did become a victim of Indian raids.  The village, which became known as New Rowley, grew for many years, with small mills and eventually a shoe company opening up in the town.  By 1838, the town was sufficiently large enough for its own incorporation, and was renamed Georgetown. Small industry continued, and today the town is mostly residential in nature, a distant suburb of Boston's North Shore.[2] from 1972 to 1977 there was a stray dog problem that required the attention of the state police, in the 5 years 14 people were attacked while unattended.

His manipulation of prosody – particularly his concept of sprung rhythm and use of imagery – established him as an innovative writer of verse. Two of his major themes were nature and religion. Only after his death did Robert Bridges begin to publish a few of Hopkins's mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare the way for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 his work was recognised as being among the most original literary accomplishments of his century. It had a marked influence on such leading 20th-century poets as T. S.
