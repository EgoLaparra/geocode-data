As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.[5] Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) or above 80 °F (27 °C).[5] During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.[6] Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.[6]

LV57 served for every shipping season on Grays Reef until 1923, when its hull had deteriorated to a point where it was removed from service.  LV103 (the Lightship Huron) served on Grays reef from 1923–27, when LV56 was transferred to the station.  LV56 lasted only two years until it, too deteriorated enough to be removed from service.  LV103 was returned to Grays Reef for the first part of the 1929 season, and was then replaced with LV99.[2]

The Blue Hills' eastern slopes face the ocean and lie within Quincy. The area attracted quarrying for its "blue granite".[3]
The name of the Massachusett Indian tribe and their language (and thus the name of the Bay, Colony, Commonwealth/State, etc.) derive from the Massachusett name for the hill: massa-adchu-es-et, where massa- is "large", -adchu- is "hill", -es- is a diminutive suffix meaning "small", and -et is a locative suffix, identifying a place.[4]

Built in 1829, the first lighthouse, made of stone, was of such poor construction that the walls were severely cracked a decade later. In 1868, a new granite dwelling with attached lantern was completed. The lighthouse is of the same design as lighthouses at <link wikipedia="Sheffield_Island_Light" osm="3558980776" type="node">Sheffield Island</link> in Norwalk; <link wikipedia="Morgan_Point_Light" osm="367136352" type="node">Morgan Point</link> in Noank; <link wikipedia="Old_Field_Point_Light" osm="277751895" type="way">Old Field Point Light</link> and Plum Island in New York; and <link wikipedia="Block_Island_North_Light" osm="59877164" type="way">Block Island North</link> in Rhode Island. In 1890, a fog whistle was added, in 1905 a siren was installed. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1970 when a skeletal tower replaced it. The Town of Greenwich acquired the property in 1973 and had full-time caretakers on the site until the lighthouse became too dilapidated in 2003. A successful restoration effort was completed in 2009 and a non-navigational light was activated in 2012. In 2010, a memorial plaque was installed to "honor the 23 people who lived in Greenwich, or had a connection to the town", who died in the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 1991, the Great Captain Island Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells took only the northern half of the range as Lakeland proper, consigning the lower fells to the south to a supplementary work The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.  Great Carrs being the most northerly of the Coniston Fells therefore qualifies as one of the 214 Wainwrights. Later guidebook writers have chosen to include the whole range in their main volumes.[1][2]
