It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.[1] At the time of its nomination it contained 12 resources, which included 10 contributing buildings, one non-contributing building, and one non-contributing site.[2] It is located on the northeast side of the central business district. The commercial buildings located here are mostly architect designed, which gives each of them a unique appearance. At the same time, it is a cohesive collection of buildings that exhibit early 20th century styles that are not found anywhere else in Ottumwa.[2] They were either built or they had a new facade added from 1903 to 1930. Eight of the buildings are free-standing, and two of them are set back on their lots. For the most part the buildings housed professional offices and leisure activities. A few of them housed retail business. The Benson Block, the <link wikipedia="Benson_Building_(Ottumwa,_Iowa)" osm="484651191" type="way">Benson Building</link>, and the <link wikipedia="J.W._Garner_Building" osm="484651189" type="way">J.W.

Grebe Lake comprises the headwaters of the <link wikipedia="Gibbon_River" osm="2596164" type="relation">Gibbon River</link>.  Grebe Lake is located approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 km) north of the Norris-Canyon section of the Grand Loop Road.  The trail to the lake passes through mostly level Lodgepole Pine forest and open meadows. The lake was named by J.P.

      <p id="GL212_316_002" num_links="4">In 1921, U.S. Fish Commission personnel stocked Grebe Lake, at that time fishless, with the Montana strain Thymallus arcticus montanus of a lacustrine form  of Arctic Grayling.  The original stocks came from Georgetown Lake near <link wikipedia="Anaconda,_Montana" osm="150938709" type="node">Anaconda, Montana</link>.

In an effort to re-establish grayling in western states, over 72 million grayling eggs were harvested from Grebe Lake between 1931 and 1956 and distributed to hatcheries. Most lake dwelling grayling in the west today can be genetically traced to the Grebe Lake stocks,.[4][5]  Grebe Lake was closed to fishing until 1944 because of the fish culture operations at the lake.  Wolf Lake 2 miles (3.2 km) west and Cascade Lake 3 miles (4.8 km) east also contain grayling.

It has many extremely dangerous curves, and accidents happen frequently.[citation needed] Currently, there are no plans to replace it with a bypass or reconstruct certain dangerous parts, but there has been an effort to increase police presence to prevent illegal racing and violation of speed limits which were common phenomena over the last 10 years.

Green Island and Strahmburg have had their names used interchangeably over the years because, in part, the post office in Strahmburg was officially designated as Green Island. Supposedly Green Island acquired its name came the color of its lush vegetation.[1][2] Though called an island, it was physically connected to Nebraska by a swampy, low-lying area along its southern edge[3][4][5][1]. Both were destroyed by the Great Flood of 1881 on the Missouri. Their history is better understood knowing the braided, meandering, flood-prone history of the Missouri River in that area. Completion of <link wikipedia="Gavins_Point_Dam" osm="723838195" type="way">Gavins Point Dam</link> in 1957, 5 miles upriver from the former location of Strahmburg, greatly reduced the risk of floods on the river. Today the Missouri National Recreational River, 59-miles between Gavins Point Dam and Ponca State Park, has restrictions on commercial development. Early maps indicate the presence of numerous islands some of which, like Green Island, no longer exist.
