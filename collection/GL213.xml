      <p id="GL213_092_002" num_links="2">Until 1854 Greene was a swamp with a cart path running through it. The path connected Hopkins Hollow to the south and Rice City to the north. In the early 1850s, the railroad came to the area. The original train stop was known as "Coffin Station" because Coffin Road was the nearest road. In 1856 railroad officials renamed the station "Greene" after the Revolutionary War hero.[4] It was decided to build a depot where local farmers could sell their produce to the trains heading towards <link wikipedia="Providence,_Rhode_Island" osm="158811904 191210" type="node relation">Providence</link> and <link wikipedia="Hartford,_Connecticut" osm="60647966 3909995" type="node relation">Hartford</link>.

It uses direct action, lobbying, research, and ecotage[6] to achieve its goals. The global organization does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on three million individual supporters and foundation grants.[7][8] Greenpeace has a general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council[9] and is a founding member[10] of the INGO Accountability Charter, an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations.

Also located on the property is the First Presbyterian Church cemetery, established in 1831, after the first church was built on land that was donated by Jesse H.

In the 1800s there was a town, <link wikipedia="Higden,_Arkansas" osm="111405" type="relation">Higden</link>, in the valley flooded by the lake. The farmers in Higden had constant trouble with flooding. The land was purchased, residents left and the city was abandoned, the cemeteries were moved, and the area was allowed to flood. The town has since been re-established on a nearby hill. Many nearby residents and several eyewitness accounts tell that homes and buildings still stand under the water to this day. Several roads in town can be followed to the shore where they disappear under the water, and surface on the opposite side of the lake. Most of these roads are now used as launch ramps for boats. Old West Main Street in <link wikipedia="Heber_Springs,_Arkansas" osm="6688024" type="relation">Heber Springs</link> is an example.

      <p id="GL213_397_001" num_links="3">Settlements in Greifensee date back in 4000 B.C.. In 1975, a Neolithic stilt house village located on the northern shore of the <link wikipedia="Greifensee" osm="1678346" type="relation">Lake Greifen</link> area called Böschen was discovered by recreational divers. Initially, they found ceramics, lavishly decorated pots and bowls, and simple, large food tanks. In scientific dives, the remains of a village with 24 huts have been revealed. The excellent condition of the timber relicts allows dendrochronological dating to the year 1051 B.C. Weaving spindles made of clay, tools, needles and fishing hooks from bronze, charred wild apples and cereals have been conserved. Ten years after its construction, the settlement was destroyed by a fire and not rebuilt. For the subsequent years, in the canton of Zürich various archaeological relicts have been found, such as heavy bronze bracelets, glass, mainly bronze fibulas and flint blades probably from the Mediterranean and France. Relicts dating to the Roman period have been found in neighbouring municipalities, in Riedikon (<link wikipedia="Uster" osm="1378906317 1682225" type="node relation">Uster</link>), and about nine kilometers away near Pfäffikon ZH located at Lake Pfäffikon (<link wikipedia="Irgenhausen_Castrum" osm="3876182" type="relation">Irgenhausen Castrum</link>).
