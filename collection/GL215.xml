Glanshammar may also refer to a mythic weapon wielded by Oden, and later by Thor.  The weapon was never clearly described in Norse mythology, but is often referred to in vague, and almost reverential, terms.  Oral tradition in Icelandic and Norwegian lineages indicates that the weapon may have resembled a spade or even a small, wide obelisk.  It may have been used in conjunction with the more widely known Hammer of Thor, but in and of itself, it was a said to be a formidable implement, and in some ancient traditions, was considered to bestow invincibility upon its master.[citation needed]

Formerly a cable railway, the Subway was later electrified, but its two circular tracks were never expanded. The line was originally known as the Glasgow District Subway, but was later renamed Glasgow Subway Railway. It was so called when taken over by the Glasgow Corporation who renamed it the Glasgow Underground in 1936. Despite this rebranding, many Glaswegians continued to refer to the network as "the Subway". In 2003 the name "Subway" was officially readopted by its operator, the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT). A £40,000 study examining the feasibility of an expansion into the city's south side was conducted in 2005 while a further commitment from Labour in 2007 to extend to the East End was also to no avail.[3]

Upon another dangerous incident, the single level triangle from 1912 was rebuilt and replaced by the current two-level station. Since then there is no direct rail connection between the two lines at Gleisdreieck, but only an intersection.

Gleiszellen's first mention in a historical document dates to 1136, whereas Gleishorbach first appeared in a historical record in 1304. Both sit at the bottom of a small mountain called the Hatzelberg, which overlooks the Rhine valley; Gleiszellen now also occupies a good portion of the slopes of the Hatzelberg, having expanded into what were once fields and vineyards. Gleiszellen and Gleishorbach boast picturesque streets at their centers, with many old timberframe houses. The villages are surrounded by vineyards; on their western side, they border the Pfälzerwald, with its extensive forests and hiking paths.

The "Parallel Roads" of Glen Roy are loch terraces that formed along the shorelines of an ancient ice-dammed loch. The loch existed during a brief period (some 900-1,100 years in duration) of climatic deterioration, during a much longer period of deglaciation, subsequent to the last main ice age (The Devensian). From a distance they resemble man-made roads running along the side of the Glen, hence the name.

The old village courthouse still incorporates some of its walls, indeed an immured skeleton was discovered there in the 1970s. In 1495 Con O'Donnell of Tirconnell marched on ‘MacEoin of the Glens’ (as the Bisset chieftain was called), ‘for he had been told that MacEoin had the finest wife, steed and hound in his neighbourhood. O'Donnell had sent messengers for the steed but was refused it so he made no delay, but surmounting the difficulties of every passage he arrived at night at MacEoin's house without giving any warning of his designs. He captured MacEoin and made himself master of his wife his steed and his hound'. The last MacEoin Bisset was killed fighting the O'Donnells in 1522. Their lands were then seized by the MacDonnells, their former partners, who occupied the Bisset's castle until they built the new one.[1]

The Ayrshire/Lanarkshire border runs north to south across the Loch. The "Loch" is in fact a dam created in 1802 by James Finlay for his <link wikipedia="Catrine" osm="1343225358" type="node">Catrine</link> cotton works. Much of the dam banks were created by French prisoners of war.  The dam was situated so that the water to power the mill took exactly 12 hours to reach Catrine. The Tenant of West Glenbuck Farm had his rent paid by James Findlay to open the sluice at 18.00 and close it at 06.00, mirroring exactly the working hours of the Mill. The water turned the famous Catrine Wheel which powered the Mill. The double wheel was 15.24 metres in diameter and revolved three times per minute, using 240 tonnes of water whilst generating 500 horse power.  [1] The water also powered a dozen other water mills downstream. The dam's creation largely drained the valley downstream and thus allowed the road to be relocated into the valley floor along the route of the modern A70 and paved the way for the adjacent railway line around 1839. Previously the land was a dense bog with the old coach road higher up on the opposite side of valley running below Wee Darnhunch then west across the fields along to Darnhunch Farm where gaps in the stone walls (dykes) shows the old Toll Route.
