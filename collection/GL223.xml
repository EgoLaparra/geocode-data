It has three main units and receives prisoners from all over the world, but has no conventional security devices. The second-largest prison in Norway,[2] it was established in 2010 with a focus on rehabilitation; its design simulates life outside the prison. Among other activities, sports and music are available to the prisoners, who interact with the unarmed staff to create a sense of community. Praised for its humane conditions, Halden Prison has received the Arnstein Arneberg Award for its interior design in 2010 and been the subject of a documentary, but has also received criticism for being too liberal.

Now the ruins of fort remained on the rock known as Kharmang khar where it was built by Baig Manthal founder of Yabgo dynasty.  This fort was present up to 1750 A.D as this fort is mentioned in Shigar Nama (an old history book of baltistan Shigar), where Hatam khan of Yabgo had ruled.[1][2]

The northern end of the tunnel is at Sunde, just south of Husnes, and the southern entrance to the tunnel is just north of the village of Sæbøvik on Halsnøy.  The 4,120-metre (13,520 ft) long tunnel reaches a depth of 135 metres (443 ft) below mean sea level. Located on County Road 544, it opened on 8 March 2008 and is as of May 2019 a toll road. The project included 2.2 kilometers (1.4 mi) of new road and cost 427 million Norwegian krone.  Prior to the opening of this tunnel in 2008, the island of Halsnøy was the most populous island in Norway with no road connection.[1]  As an energy conservation measure, the tunnel is not fully illuminated at night, but rather when a vehicle approaches the tunnel, sensors turn on the lights, and then when all vehicles have exited the tunnel, the lights turn off again.[2]

In 1177, the Crown's clerical appointment rights were transferred by King Valdemar to Ringsted Abbey, which continued to have responsibility over Halsted Priory. At the time of the Reformation, ownership returned to the Crown, which retained it until 1719 when it was transferred to ]]Jens Juel-Vind]] in exchange for <link wikipedia="Juellinge" osm="105327882" type="way">Juellinge</link> on <link wikipedia="Zealand" osm="5175856" type="relation">Zealand</link>.
