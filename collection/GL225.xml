The name "Hanger" comes from Old English/Anglo-Saxon term for "wood on a hill" or "wooded hill",[3][4] applied to Hanger Wood due to its situation on a northwest-facing slope of a narrow ridge.[1] Commenting on the wood's character, A. Simco said in 1984 that "It has been strongly influenced by the geology and topography of the area, particularly by the south-west/north-east boulder clay ridge along which the parish boundary runs."[3]

The structure is kept in place with oak crossbeams fitted into holes chiseled into the cliffs. The main supportive structure is hidden inside the bedrock.[1] The monastery is located in the small canyon basin, and the body of the building hangs from the middle of the cliff under the prominent summit, protecting the temple from rain erosion and sunlight. Coupled with the repair of the dynasties, the color tattoo in the temple is relatively well preserved.

The instigator of the Otter Centre was Claus Reuther who became its head from the outset. The facility suffered a setback in 1993 when there was a serious fire in the main building. Reuther was accused of causing the fire but was cleared by the court in 1995. He died in 2004.[2]

There were six separate villages settled within the town North Hanover, Four Corners, West Hanover, Center Hanover, South Hanover, and Drinkwater.  Hanover's early industry revolved around farming, small mills and a shipbuilding area along the North River.  Later industries would include tack factories and shoe factories along the smaller waterways in the town. The town was the site of the invention of the first tack-making machine, and making tacks and fireworks were among the industries of the later 19th century for Hanover.

It was earlier called Buck's Crossing and then Adamstown, but was renamed Hanover. Records from 1867, indicate a gristmill, sawmill and carding mill, a foundry and a cabinet factory.

The line was known as the Granvin Line (Granvinbanen) until February 1936. In 2016 Palmafoss established an emergency freight terminal and the tracks were reestablished.
