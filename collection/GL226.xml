Harford County Airport is a general aviation (GA) airport in northern <link wikipedia="Maryland" osm="316964668 162112" type="node relation">Maryland</link> that serves primarily recreational pilots. There are three runways at Harford, two grass/turf and one paved. The popular runway in the summer time is the grass runway 01/19. However, in November, the turf is closed as the grass generally remains wet and soggy over the winter months. The diagonal turf runway 14/32 is rarely used by powered pilots except during high crosswind conditions. The prevailing winds generally vary between favoring 28 and 19. The airport has a large sailplane/glider contingent and is home of the Atlantic Soaring Club. The airport serves some commercial activities, mainly sight seeing and flight training (through Harford Air Services) as well as biplane rides and hot air balloons (run by Light Flight Balloons www.fun-flying.com). In the Spring of 2012 a Skydiving company, Skydive Baltimore, moved their operations from Ridgley and started operations at the airport.

The fortress is located in an altitude of maximum 766 metres above  sea level, and is approximately sited 9 km southeast from the town of <link wikipedia="Kosovo_Polje" osm="448554221" type="node">Kosovo Polje</link> and only 2 kilometres west from <link wikipedia="Pristina_International_Airport" osm="292210152" type="way">Pristina International Airport "Adem Jashari"</link>.[2] The total surface of the fortress, also counting the circular walls/ ramparts, measures around 1.3 hectares of the inner space of the stronghold. The archaeological excavations at this site were conducted in several seasons, commencing in 2005 and were carried out systematically until 2010 by the staff of the Museum of Kosovo, particularly the Archaeological Institute of Kosovo.[3] Nonetheless, several conservations and consolidations of the circuit walls were done in order to preserve the remains. During the five archaeological seasons' works, numerous remains and foundations of sacral, profane and utilitarian buildings were discovered. In regard, the entire outer sides of the rampart with towers at the axes were unearthed, as well as a church with three naves and a Saskrity are discovered, but also two almost identical structures in a rounded shape of an unknown sacral complex has been uncovered, as well. On the other hand, vast movable archaeological material composed of: metal made working tools, jewelry, coins, bricks, glass fragments and architectural structures, all clear indications that pinpoint to the Late Antique date and especially typical for the Justinian Period. Also, at this fortress traces of prehistoric periods have been evidenced, especially emphasizing the metal periods, but it continued to exist all through antiquity and up to the Medieval Period.[2] Discovered and recorded findings from this site of excavations from 2005–2008 were presented at the International Conference on Illyria: Illyri Meridionale et l'Epire dans l'antiquite, Act du V colloque internacional de Grenoble, 8–11 octobre 2008, held in <link wikipedia="Grenoble" osm="26686589 80348" type="node relation">Grenoble</link>, France.[4]

The two areas are linked by a steep, winding road called "Twtil".[4]

It was built by Edward I during his invasion of Wales between 1282 and 1289 at the relatively modest cost of £8,190.[2] Over the next few centuries, the castle played an important part in several wars, withstanding the siege of Madog ap Llywelyn between 1294–95, but falling to Owain Glyndŵr in 1404. It then became Glyndŵr's residence and military headquarters for the remainder of the uprising until being recaptured by English forces in 1409. During the 15th century Wars of the Roses, Harlech was held by the Lancastrians for seven years, before Yorkist troops forced its surrender in 1468, a siege memorialised in the song Men of Harlech. Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I, holding out until 1647 when it became the last fortification to surrender to the Parliamentary armies. In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw, the Welsh Government's historic environment service, as a tourist attraction.

After Colwyn Bay Council said he could no longer use the bandstand, a fellow puppet enthusiast named Millicent Ford who lived on the seafront at Rhos-on-Sea offered him a portion of her land on which to build a permanent puppet theatre. Architects drew up plans based on Eric Bramall's detailed ideas. The Harlequin was built in eleven weeks, using wood, glass, and local stone salvaged from derelict servants' quarters which had occupied the site.[1]  Bramall painted the murals on the auditorium walls in a single week.[4]  The Opening Ceremony was performed by Sir Clayton Russon on 7 July 1958.[4]  The resulting building won a Civic Trust Award for its design.  Its construction marked the first time in British history that a permanent theatre had been specifically designed and built for puppet playing.[4]

Beer, Herman Cohn, Charles Werner, and Sigmund Werner.  Although prominent German Jews, the group was reportedly denied admission to the Union Club, which had a tacit policy of discrimination.[citation needed]  The club's original charter provided that it was created to provide "mutually beneficial entertainment, occasional singing entertainments, lectures, etc" for recent German immigrants.  The first meeting of the club was held November 8, 1852 in a rented room on Broome Street with thirty-nine members in attendance. Between 1852 and 1867, the burgeoning club was regularly moved as the membership outgrew each rented space.  After this nomadic period the club purchased land at 45 West Forty-Second Street to erect a permanent location and raised enough funds to have architect Henry Fernbach design the building.  Later, this building was refurbished and had an annex added, both of which were designed by Herts and Tallant, architects of the <link wikipedia="Brooklyn_Academy_of_Music" osm="250979163" type="way">Brooklyn Academy of Music</link> and Coram Library at <link wikipedia="Bates_College" osm="509060524" type="way">Bates College</link>.

The home's remodeling incorporated elements that would later be found in Wright's pioneering, early modern Prairie style. Some of the remodel work included setting the home back an additional 16 ft (4.88 m) from the street and an overhanging porch over the driveway. The House is similar in some ways to Wright's other early work and was influenced by his first teacher, Joseph Silsbee. The house is considered a contributing property to both a local and federally Registered Historic District.
