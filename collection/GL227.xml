James and Charles Rossman accompanied Nicolas Simon back to Hartford in 1844, and soon bought 40 acres around the rapids of the Rubicon River.[6] After constructing a dam across rapids in the river, the Rossmans built a sawmill that harnessed the power of the water to make lumber for the growth of the area.

The Indiana Gas Boom was caused by the discovery of natural gas in the area, and it caused the community to transition from an agricultural economy to one that also included manufacturing. The boom brought residents, retail establishments, and craftspeople. The increased population meant construction of new roads, schools, and churches. After the boom came a long period of growth and stability. Agriculture (and agricultural trade) remained as the fundamental industry.

The <link wikipedia="Hartland_Point_Lighthouse" osm="56132432" type="way">Hartland Point Lighthouse</link> was built in 1874 under the direction of Sir James Douglass.[2] The Grade II-listed tower is 18 metres (59 ft) tall with the lamp being 37 metres (121 ft) above mean sea level. The light could be seen up to 25 miles (40 km) away from the coast.[3]  It was blessed by Frederick Temple, Bishop of Exeter, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. The tower was automated in 1984 and is now controlled from Trinity House Operations Centre at <link wikipedia="Harwich" osm="54054809" type="node">Harwich</link> in <link wikipedia="Essex" osm="180904" type="relation">Essex</link>.[4] Prior to automation, the lighthouse was built with accommodation for four keepers and their families. The keepers' dwellings have since been demolished to make room for a helipad to be constructed. This was necessary due to the precarious nature of the access road which is liable to frequent rock falls and landslips. Vehicular access is now very difficult and the gates tend to remain locked. The large concrete structures immediately to the south of the lighthouse provided the keepers with fresh water.

Rooms of the period cost $3.30 per week, or $129 for the academic year, which, although more expensive than a roominghouse, ultimately allowed even poor students to afford berth there. University President Nicholas Murray Butler, who presided over the hall's opening, noted that "in the interest of true democracy," rooms were arranged to allow "the poorer student to live in the same building and the same entry with him who is better off, and so avoids the chasm between rich and poor living in separate buildings, of which there is so much complaint at <link wikipedia="Harvard_University" osm="2415825" type="relation">Harvard</link>."

In 1947 the Byrne Organization made news when it set up a prefabrication shop on the 300-acre site and churned out parts for all 1,200 homes at once.  The houses featured welded steel frames which formed the basis of a structure using other materials.
The houses were constructed in two different styles with three or four rooms on a concrete slab, which sold for $6,900. The community was one of largest prefabricated developments in America.  Their construction marked the start of phenomenal post-World War II suburbanization of previously rural Anne Arundel County.

Upon Gilbert Brainard's death, the land was purchased by Amos Page, Otis Eastman, and Eldridge G. Ayer.

Shortly afterward Amos Page and Otis Eastman sold their shares of the property to Eldridge G. Ayers.

The northeast of the municipality is largely uninhabited, having been buried approximately 3000 years ago by the eruption of the Montaña Corona which formed the inhospitable Malpais de la Corona. This eruption also produced extensive hollow lava tunnels called jameos, some of which have been developed into two of the island's most-visited[citation needed] geological attractions: the <link wikipedia="Cueva_de_los_Verdes" osm="211318756" type="node">Cueva de los Verdes</link> and the <link wikipedia="Jameos_del_Agua" osm="211318753" type="node">Jameos del Agua</link>.

Hastings was established as a company town by the Hope Natural Gas Company in the early part of the 20th century.  With a population of several hundred people who lived in as many as fifty company houses, the community also had a church, a school, a company store, an athletic field, a post office, and a community hall. The community had indoor athletic facilities for basketball, table tennis and billiards, and it also served as a theater.  A hotel in the community was used by company employees who traveled to the site to perform maintenance and other tasks.  Hastings was named for Dennis Hastings, the first superintendent of the original natural gas processing plant on site.  It was a thriving community into the late 1960s when they baby boomers began to graduate from high school and their parents and grandparents began retiring and moving away.  Nowadays it is a virtual ghost town with only two company houses remaining.
