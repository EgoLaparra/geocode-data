The Hawkhurst Gang was a notorious criminal organisation involved in smuggling throughout southeast England from 1735 until 1749. One of the more infamous gangs of the early 18th century, they extended their influence from  <link wikipedia="Hawkhurst" osm="386184831" type="node">Hawkhurst</link>, their base in Kent, along the South coast, to <link wikipedia="Dorset" osm="74392" type="relation">Dorset</link>, where they successfully raided the customs house at <link wikipedia="Poole" osm="17858754 130891" type="node relation">Poole</link>.

      <p id="GL229_027_002" num_links="2">Named after the village of Hawkhurst, the gang was first mentioned as the Holkhourst Genge in 1735. The gang were based in the "Oak and Ivy Inn", Hawkhurst. A secondary headquarters  was <link wikipedia="The_Mermaid_Inn,_Rye" osm="2536765350" type="node">The Mermaid Inn</link> in the town of <link wikipedia="Rye,_East_Sussex" osm="2510480" type="node">Rye</link>, where they would sit with their loaded weapons on the table.[1] Many local legends and folklore are based on the alleged network of tunnels built by the gang. However, many hidden cellars and remote barns could have been used for storage so it is unlikely that tunnels would have been needed at that period when large armed gangs operated openly, often riding through the larger towns in daylight.[1]

Originally constructed as part of the Norman invasion of Wales, the castle was designed as a ringwork overlooking the town in either the late-11th or early-12th centuries. It was rebuilt in stone around 1200 by the de Braose family and then had a turbulent history, being attacked and burnt several times during the First and Second Barons' Wars, the wars with the Welsh princes, the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr and the Wars of the Roses. In the 17th century a Jacobean mansion house was built alongside the medieval keep and the property became a private home. Serious fires in 1939 and 1977 gutted the castle and, despite repairs in the 1980s, by the 21st century much of the building was derelict and unstable. Since 2011 it has been owned by the Hay Castle Trust who plan to renovate the property to form an arts and education centre.

It was the second camp to fail to hold the famous German escapee Franz von Werra. The escape tunnel can still be seen at the conference centre. The centre is one of the larger employers in the area, with some employees having been with the company for over 30 years. The company has a policy of using local suppliers wherever possible, especially for fresh food, and generally to be eco-friendly.

Initially, it was a one-story building with a basement. As late as the 1960s, students still rode their horses to school and tied them to hitching posts. As the number of students exceeded the campus' limit, the site was expanded from 10 to 30 acres (120,000 m2). The architecture for the new buildings included ionic columns, low-pitched roofs, and friezes of goods. This building, built in 1911, lasted until Hayward High moved to its current campus in 1962, to make way for the City Center Building.

It is located at the intersection of Eagleson Road and Hazeldean Road, where Hazeldean Road turns into Robertson Road.  It was the first enclosed shopping centre constructed in Kanata.  The development of the mall was approved shortly before the incorporation of the (then) City of Kanata, and its approval led to a legal battle between the constituent parts of the new municipality over the appropriate location of what would at that time be the new city's main commercial hub.[1]

</p>
      <p id="GL229_281_002" num_links="3">The site of the mall was zoned for commercial uses in 1962 at the time that the surrounding community of Glen Cairn was planned.[2] The "Glen Cairn Shopping Centre" proposal was approved in 1978 by <link wikipedia="Goulbourn_Township,_Ontario" osm="9245428 9246628" type="relation relation">Goulbourn Township</link>, only months before Glen Cairn ceased to be part of Goulbourn and was amalgamated with <link wikipedia="March_Township,_Ontario" osm="9246627" type="relation">March Township</link> and parts of <link wikipedia="Nepean,_Ontario" osm="9082082 9245438" type="relation relation">Nepean Township</link> into the new City of Kanata.  March Township Council initiated legal action, ultimately unsuccessful, to significantly reduce the size of the Glen Cairn Shopping Centre development on the grounds that it would adversely affect the market potential for March's own Kanata Town Centre development proposal.  March Township officials hoped that the Town Centre, located closer to the geographic centre of the new municipality than the Hazeldean Mall, would spur development of a new retail and office core for Kanata.[1][3]  The competing Town Centre project eventually obtained final approvals in 1980, after the Hazeldean Mall had opened.[4]

At the top of the mountain there is the ruin of a mediaeval castle, of which two towers and some wall fragments are still standing. A smaller first castle was already built there in the late 13th century by the Lichtenburg noble family. Later, the site was home to the Zajíc family: in 1335, Zbyněk Zajíc, a powerful aristocrat during the times of Charles IV., purchased it, and made it the center of his estates. In Czech, the word zajíc means hare, so the name of castle and hill is a mediaeval play on the name of its most prominent owners, who even had hares in their coat of arms. Zbyněk Zajíc considerably enlarged and extended the castle, and in particular added the two prominent towers which survive to this day.
