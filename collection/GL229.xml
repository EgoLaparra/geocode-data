The modern name for the hill was given by early European explorers who, while sailing along the coastline, noticed the bluish hue of the exposed granite faces when viewed from a distance (due to Riebeckite). The Blue Hills' eastern slopes face the ocean and lie within Quincy. The area attracted quarrying for its "blue granite".[3]
The name of the Massachusett Indian tribe and their language (and thus the name of the Bay, Colony, Commonwealth/State, etc.) derive from the Massachusett name for the hill: massa-adchu-es-et, where massa- is "large", -adchu- is "hill", -es- is a diminutive suffix meaning "small", and -et is a locative suffix, identifying a place.[4]

Built in 1829, the first lighthouse, made of stone, was of such poor construction that the walls were severely cracked a decade later. In 1868, a new granite dwelling with attached lantern was completed. The lighthouse is of the same design as lighthouses at <link wikipedia="Sheffield_Island_Light" osm="3558980776" type="node">Sheffield Island</link> in Norwalk; <link wikipedia="Morgan_Point_Light" osm="367136352" type="node">Morgan Point</link> in Noank; <link wikipedia="Old_Field_Point_Light" osm="277751895" type="way">Old Field Point Light</link> and Plum Island in New York; and <link wikipedia="Block_Island_North_Light" osm="59877164" type="way">Block Island North</link> in Rhode Island. In 1890, a fog whistle was added, in 1905 a siren was installed. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1970 when a skeletal tower replaced it. The Town of Greenwich acquired the property in 1973 and had full-time caretakers on the site until the lighthouse became too dilapidated in 2003. A successful restoration effort was completed in 2009 and a non-navigational light was activated in 2012. In 2010, a memorial plaque was installed to "honor the 23 people who lived in Greenwich, or had a connection to the town", who died in the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 1991, the Great Captain Island Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Great Carrs being the most northerly of the Coniston Fells therefore qualifies as one of the 214 Wainwrights. Later guidebook writers have chosen to include the whole range in their main volumes.[1][2]

      <p id="GL229_432_002" num_links="3">The museum hosts the mosaics used to decorate the pavement of a peristyle court, dating possibly to the reign of Byzantine emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565), although more recent analysis hints at a later date, possibly even the reign of Heraclius.[1] It was uncovered by British archaeologists from the <link wikipedia="University_of_St_Andrews" osm="3504913908" type="node">University of St Andrews</link> in <link wikipedia="Scotland" osm="58446" type="relation">Scotland</link> during extensive excavations at the Arasta Bazaar in <link wikipedia="Hippodrome_of_Constantinople" osm="25512790" type="way">Sultan Ahmet Square</link> in 1935–1938 and 1951–1954. The area formed part of the south-western Great Palace, and the excavations discovered a large peristyle courtyard, with a surface of 1872 m², entirely decorated with mosaics. It was at this point that the Austrian Academy of Sciences, supervised by Prof. Dr. Werner Jobst, undertook to study and preserve the famous palace mosaic and to carry out additional archeological examinations (1983–1997) within the scope of a cooperative project with the Directorate General of Monuments and Museums in Turkey.

Around 1050, Saint Bernard of Menthon, archdeacon of Aosta, regularly saw travellers arriving terrorised and distressed, so he decided to put an end to mountain brigandage in the area. With this in mind, he founded the hospice at the pass which later bore his name (it was originally dedicated to St Nicholas). The church's first textual mention is in a document of 1125. The hospice was placed under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Sion, prefect and count of <link wikipedia="Canton_of_Valais" osm="1686699" type="relation">Valais</link>, thus explaining why the whole pass is now in Swiss territory.

It served as the main place of worship of the deity Aten during the reign of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten (c. 1353-1336 BCE[2]).[3] Akhenaten ushered in a unique period of ancient Egyptian history by establishing the new religious cult dedicated to the sun-disk Aten. The king shut down traditional worship of other deities like Amun-Ra, and brought in a new era, though short-lived, of seeming monotheism where the Aten was worshipped as a sun god and Akhenaten and his wife, Nefertiti, represented the divinely royal couple that connected the people with the god.[3] Although he began construction at <link wikipedia="Karnak" osm="768583133 298144107" type="node way">Karnak</link> during his rule, the association the city had with other gods drove Akhenaten to establish a new city and capital at Amarna for the Aten.

The Great Temple of the Aten was located just north of the Central City and, as the largest temple dedicated to the Aten, was where Akhenaten fully established the proper cult and worship of the sun-disk.[3]
