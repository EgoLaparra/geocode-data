The commercial buildings located here are mostly architect designed, which gives each of them a unique appearance. At the same time, it is a cohesive collection of buildings that exhibit early 20th century styles that are not found anywhere else in Ottumwa.[2] They were either built or they had a new facade added from 1903 to 1930. Eight of the buildings are free-standing, and two of them are set back on their lots. For the most part the buildings housed professional offices and leisure activities. A few of them housed retail business.

In an effort to re-establish grayling in western states, over 72 million grayling eggs were harvested from Grebe Lake between 1931 and 1956 and distributed to hatcheries. Most lake dwelling grayling in the west today can be genetically traced to the Grebe Lake stocks,.[4][5]  Grebe Lake was closed to fishing until 1944 because of the fish culture operations at the lake.  Wolf Lake 2 miles (3.2 km) west and Cascade Lake 3 miles (4.8 km) east also contain grayling.

Green Island and Strahmburg have had their names used interchangeably over the years because, in part, the post office in Strahmburg was officially designated as Green Island. Supposedly Green Island acquired its name came the color of its lush vegetation.[1][2] Though called an island, it was physically connected to Nebraska by a swampy, low-lying area along its southern edge[3][4][5][1]. Both were destroyed by the Great Flood of 1881 on the Missouri. Their history is better understood knowing the braided, meandering, flood-prone history of the Missouri River in that area. Completion of <link wikipedia="Gavins_Point_Dam" osm="723838195" type="way">Gavins Point Dam</link> in 1957, 5 miles upriver from the former location of Strahmburg, greatly reduced the risk of floods on the river.

Early maps indicate the presence of numerous islands some of which, like Green Island, no longer exist.

The former Presbyterian church was built in 1892, and is a Romanesque Revival style brick building with a cross gable roof and tower. The semi-circular, 11 bay, Smith Memorial Building was built in 1903. It features four octagonal sides and a tower. The memorial building was designed by the architect Charles Christian Hook (1870-1938). The church and memorial building were connected and the older structures modified and renovated in 1938. Also located on the property is the First Presbyterian Church cemetery, established in 1831, after the first church was built on land that was donated by Jesse H. Lindsay.[2] The church vacated the property in 1929, and in 1937-1938 it was renovated and enlarged as the Richardson Civic Center and donated to the city of Greensboro. It subsequently housed the Greensboro Public Library, the Greensboro Historical Museum, and the Greensboro Art Center.[3] The historic building functions as one part of the current, larger Greenboro History Museum.
