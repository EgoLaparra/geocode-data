Since the 19th century, Darnall has been a centre of the coal and steel industry in Sheffield. High Hazels House, located in the park, was built in 1850 by William Jeffcock (the first Mayor of Sheffield). In 1894, Sheffield City Council (the Corporation of Sheffield) bought the land and house from the Duke of Norfolk and Messers Jeffcock for £10,875. In 1895, the land was first used as a public recreation ground and was classed as one of the finest parks within the city of Sheffield.[2] The park used to be home to a boating lake, which has since been filled in.

The windmill ground flour for the <link wikipedia="Worthing" osm="29801815 117548" type="node relation">Worthing</link> area until 1897 when it was purchased by Colonel T F Wisden. A condition of sale was that the mill had to be kept in working order.[3] It was retired to a role of grinding animal feed until 1905.[citation needed] During much of the 20th century the mill was neglected although in 1907 the wooden roundhouse was replaced with a concrete structure used as a tea-room. In 1959, the mill was taken into the care of Worthing Borough Council. Messrs E Hole and Son, millwrights of <link wikipedia="Burgess_Hill" osm="17723728" type="node">Burgess Hill</link> renovated the mill in 1961 and fitted a new pair of stocks and four new sails. In March 1976 one of the sails was broken off in a gale, and the other three removed. An inspection of the mill revealed she was not in good repair. Worthing Town Council set up a restoration project.[3] The roundhouse was rebuilt to better replicate the original in 1990[2] and the restored mill began grinding again in 1991. A granary rescued from <link wikipedia="East_Grinstead" osm="17725071" type="node">East Grinstead</link> was re-erected at the mill in 1994. In 1998 it was discovered that one of the stocks was split. A new stock was made from laminated larch and the sails were refitted.[4]
