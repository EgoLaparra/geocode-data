From the 18th century onwards, many further ones were added.  Many figures long thought to be ancient have been found to be relatively recent when subjected to modern archaeological scrutiny, at least in their current form. Only the Uffington White Horse appears to retain a prehistoric shape, while the Cerne Abbas Giant may be prehistoric, Romano-British, or Early Modern. Nevertheless, these figures, and their possible lost companions, have been iconic in the English people's conception of their past.

The area declined in the early 90s however in recent times a wave of new immigrants from Northern Iraq (Kurdistan) Iran as well as various people's from Africa have settled and have invested into the area and now the area is a lively neighbourhood bustling with shops and restaurants selling intercontinental produce and cuisine.
