From 1884 on, the church ran a parish school. The church was closed after the Germans entered to Kaunas during World War I. As soon as Lithuania regained independence, the new government confiscated all the Orthodox churches in Kaunas, regarding them as signs of intensive Russification, leaving only the smallest one - the Holy Resurrection Church - in the hands of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1923 the church was renovated and reconsecrated by the Lithuanian Orthodox metropolitan Elevferiy (Bogojavlensky).

Jefferson County's first Methodists were present by the 1780s, appearing in Richard Butler's journal during an expedition to remove squatters from Indian country in 1785.  Methodist preachers were active in Steubenville during 1794; a circuit had been formed by 1796, and a separate congregation was formed before long.  When Francis Asbury visited Steubenville to preach in 1803, he observed that their usual meeting place, <link wikipedia="Jefferson_County_Courthouse_(Ohio)" osm="368151985" type="node">the courthouse</link>, was too small to hold everyone.[2]:402  Several years passed before this problem was resolved; some members formed a separate congregation nearby in 1810, and wealthy member Bezaleel Wells donated land at the corner of Fourth and South Streets in Steubenville upon which a church was ready for use by the end of 1811.  Epidemics carried away many in 1813, but the numbers continued to swell as revival meetings won numerous converts,[2]:403 and while the new building was complete by 1814, an expansion was necessary as early as 1821.[2]:404  By 1824, the church was larger than any other in Steubenville, but the coming of New Light preachers caused a split, as the newcomers won away many Methodists.[2]:342  Membership stood at 178 in 1830, but 82 members left during the national schism that produced the Methodist Protestant Church in that year, and an epidemic of scarlet fever killed many younger members in the following year.[2]:404  Nevertheless, the congregation eventually began to regain its strength; the members living in northern Steubenville became a separate congregation in 1845, but eleven years later, the original building was replaced with a larger structure that was expanded in 1871.  Further church planting was conducted in 1867 and 1870, but by 1910, membership was approximately 650.[2]:405  Consequently, the present building was constructed on the same site in 1914.[1]

A large portion of the ranch comprised portions of the old G4 Ranch (named after Survey Block G4), established by John and Clarence Gano in the 1880s. Wilson's ranch focused on sheep and goats, the first such large operation in the Big Bend area.[2]  Wilson continued to live at the ranch until his death in 1943; his family moved from the ranch the next year.

One hundred years later, much of the existing farmland on the flats and hillsides by the river was purchased, laid out in lots and sold by local banks and land owners to create the town of Homestead. The town was chartered in 1880. The building of a railroad, glass factory, and in 1881 the first iron mill began a period of rapid growth and prosperity. In 1883, Andrew Carnegie bought out Homestead Steel Works, adding it to his empire of steel and coke enterprises. Carnegie had recently acquired a controlling interest in Henry Clay Frick's coke works on the Monongahela, setting the stage for the dramatic labor clash in Homestead.

The island was originally created when G. A. Furgason, a developer of the Homosassa area, hired a dragline operator to create the island from a pile of rocks submerged during high tide in order to keep boats from running aground.  The island derives its name from the monkeys relocated to the island from the <link wikipedia="Homosassa_Springs_Wildlife_State_Park" osm="321225195" type="way">Homosassa Springs Wildlife Park</link> in the 1960s.  The monkeys were moved from the park due to their "problematic" behavior, including stealing candy, entering cars, and biting visitors. The river acts as a natural fence because the monkeys prefer not to swim.  Currently five spider monkeys inhabit the island, three of which are from the original relocation. The island contains a lighthouse, Cedar trees, and a monkey "playground". They are fed fresh fruit daily by staff members.

Businessman L. Honigsberger built the store in 1865, replacing the original store he built in 1861. The brick building was designed in the Neoclassical style. The store served Copperopolis during its first copper boom in the 1860s; however, an 1867 fire and declining copper production caused Copperopolis to lose most of its population and severely diminished the store's business. In 1905, the Honigsberger family sold the store to the Union Copper Mining Company, which became the Calaveras Copper Mining Company four years later. The company used the store as a warehouse during another copper boom in Copperopolis from 1909 to 1929. The store is one of only four extant buildings from Copperopolis' first copper boom in the 1860s.[2]
