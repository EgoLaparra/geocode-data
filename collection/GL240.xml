Ordered to retreat to Australia, the ship was disguised as a tropical island to avoid detection, and was the last Dutch ship to escape from the region. On arriving in Australia in 1942, she was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as HMAS Abraham Crijnssen and operated as an anti-submarine escort.

Construction of the mill building in brick and stone was completed by June 1780, and the reported death of a young man attempting to climb on the water wheel suggests that it was operational at this date.[2] After initially investigating the purchase of a steam engine from the <link wikipedia="Birmingham" osm="69609294" type="way">Birmingham</link> firm of Boulton and Watt,[3] Arkwright installed a reciprocating steam engine, probably manufactured by Francis Thompson of <link wikipedia="Ashover" osm="29389167" type="node">Ashover</link>, to supplement the occasionally inadequate water supply.[2] This was a medium-sized engine with a 26-foot-long (7.9 m) beam, an 18-foot-diameter (5.5 m) flywheel[2] a 30-inch-diameter (760 mm) cylinder and a stroke of 5 feet (1.5 m).[3] Similar to engines commonly used at the time to pump out nearby mines, it operated 24 hours a day, powering two pumps.[3]

It was dug in 1631, making it the oldest tow-canal in Holland.[1] Travel on such canals was historically done by barges (or trekschuit in Dutch) which were towed by animals (and sometimes by man-power) on a path along the canal's edge (towpath).

</p>
      <p id="GL240_226_002" num_links="4">Until the beginning of the 17th century, the primary waterway between Amsterdam and Haarlem was the IJ, a bay of the Zuiderzee. The land route was over the twisty dike along this bay. In 1631 construction began and the canal was dug in a virtually straight line to guarantee the shortest route. It shortened the waterway from Haarlem to <link wikipedia="Amsterdam" osm="268396336 271110" type="node relation">Amsterdam</link> considerably. Until that time, boats needed to travel up the Spaarne river to pass the narrow sluice gate at <link wikipedia="Spaarndam" osm="158059" type="relation">Spaarndam</link>, to reach the IJ. Similarly, the towpath shortened the route considerably for land traffic.

The early 20th century saw it as a place of public recreation, and the State of Connecticut purchased the island and made it a state park in 1944.

It lies about 17 miles (27 km) east of <link wikipedia="Edinburgh" osm="5410114250" type="node">Edinburgh</link>.[2] The name Haddington is Anglo-Saxon, dating from the sixth or seventh century AD[3] when the area was incorporated into the kingdom of Bernicia. The town, like the rest of the Lothian region, was ceded by King Edgar of England and became part of Scotland in the tenth century.  Haddington received burghal status, one of the earliest to do so, during the reign of David I (1124–1153),[4] giving it trading rights which encouraged its growth into a market town.
