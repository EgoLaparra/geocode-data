However, the booming copper industry in the Keweenaw quickly swelled the populace of Houghton County, and a new courthouse was planned to demonstrate the area's prosperity.  The county hired <link wikipedia="Marquette,_Michigan" osm="153528543 134503" type="node relation">Marquette</link> architect J. B. Sweatt to design the courthouse, which was built on the site of the older courthouse at a cost of $75,568.00.[3]  The cornerstone, with a miner's coat of arms, was laid on July 24, 1886,[4] and the new courthouse was dedicated on July 28, 1887.[2]

The water tank was repaired using its own steel, which resulted in a reduced capacity of 30,000 imperial gallons (140,000 l).[3] In 1977 the water tower was made redundant by a mains water supply to the village, and additional living space was created. In 1979 the main water tank was removed to fully convert the building into a house. The building currently has five bedrooms and three bathrooms; it contains a total of 85 steps from top to bottom and is around 70 ft high.

She grew up in a middle-class churchgoing family along with an older brother and two adopted siblings, a brother and a sister, who were Korean.  Her  mother and father divorced when she was 14.  She began taking LSD, Benzedrine, and smoking hashish around age 15, running away for a time but returning to complete high school. At 17, she became pregnant and was forced by her mother to undergo an abortion. Van Houten's mother informed her sometime later that the procedure could not be referred to as an abortion as the fetus was too mature. She instructed the girl to bury the late term aborted baby in their backyard.[4] Van Houten stated that after this event, she felt very removed from her mother and harbored intense anger toward her. She had a period of interest in yoga and took a year-long secretarial course, but became a hippie, living at a commune.[5][6][7][8]

The area was for a long time part of the village <link wikipedia="Loosduinen" osm="1522987186" type="node">Loosduinen</link> and during this period was a green area used by farmers with no residents living on it. The farmers used the area for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, which then could be sold to the villagers via the local market or to other people in the surrounding areas. To do this the farmers made use of the canal in <link wikipedia="Loosduinen" osm="1522987186" type="node">Loosduinen</link>, since this was the most efficient way to transport the fruits and vegetables in both a cheap and fast manner. Furthermore, to sell their vegetables and fruits to nearby areas the farmers could make use of the Oude Haagweg, which is a road that has been used since medieval times and connects <link wikipedia="Loosduinen" osm="1522987186" type="node">Loosduinen</link> with the cities 's-Gravenzande and 's-Gravenhage.

The site cost £400 (equivalent to £39,600 in 2019).[1]  A second-hand temporary building made of iron was erected, but it had to be taken down in 1892; the congregation, who were Wesleyans, had to share another Methodist church in Hove with its Primitive Methodist community until they were able to build a permanent structure.[2]

In 1843, it is said, the last Indian battle in Grayson County was fought in the area. The first settlers of Howe were Jabez and Harriet Haning, and Jabez's brother John. They received land through the Peters colony after their arrival from <link wikipedia="Pennsylvania" osm="316987717 162109" type="node relation">Pennsylvania</link> before 1850. The Houston and Texas Central Railway built through the area in 1873, and a railroad switch was located in the community. It was called "Summit" because at 810 feet (250 m) above sea level it was supposed to be the highest point between the <link wikipedia="Red_River_of_the_South" osm="2183785" type="relation">Red River</link> and the <link wikipedia="Gulf_of_Mexico" osm="305639190" type="node">Gulf of Mexico</link>. In 1873, when Summit received a post office, two businesses were located at the switch: a general store and a saloon. Several houses were built to the east of the switch. Jabez Haning persuaded the railroad to establish a depot on his land by donating every second lot in his newly platted town to the railroad. The name of the depot, the store, and the post office was changed in 1876 to "Howe", after F. M. Howe, who worked for the Houston and Texas Central. Howe had three saloons until around 1900, when the town voted to go dry. Its first one-room school building opened in 1877 and was replaced by a two-story building in 1884.
