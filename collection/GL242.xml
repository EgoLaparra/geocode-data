The bridge was mostly destroyed in the 1936 flood that destroyed the golf course. The bridge was built to allow cows to move back and forth to the island for grazing. The island is not listed as an airport on any aeronautical charts. More than likely, that reference is to the area of the River on the north side of the island which was listed for landing seaplanes, and connected to an airfield which was previously located on Coffin Rd where there is now a marina.

      <p id="GL242_390_002" num_links="2">Hamarøy Church is located on an old church site. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1589, but the building wasn't new at that time.  The old stave church was torn down in 1655 and replaced with a new building on the same site.  It was a timber-framed cruciform design.  That church was replaced in 1775 by another church that is now known as the "Old Hamarøy Church".  In 1840, the church was renovated and repaired.  In 1885, the Old Hamarøy Church was taken down and moved to the village of Karlsøy on the nearby island of <link wikipedia="Finnøya,_Nordland" osm="7668196" type="relation">Finnøya</link> where it is now known as the <link wikipedia="Sagfjord_Church" osm="557512803" type="way">Sagfjord Church</link>.  After moving the old church to Karlsøy, a new Hamarøy Church was built to replace it just to the north of the old church site.  This "new" church burned down in October 1969 after a lightning strike.  The present church was completed in 1974.[4][5]

There are also various buildings in a rustic or vernacular style, inspired by Norman or Flemish design, situated around an irregular pond fed by a stream that turned a mill wheel.[1]  The building scheme included a farmhouse, (the farm was to produce milk and eggs for the queen), a dairy, a dovecote, a boudoir, a barn that burned down during the French Revolution, a mill and a tower in the form of a lighthouse. Each building is decorated with a garden, an orchard or a flower garden. The largest and most famous of these houses is the "Queen's House", connected to the Billiard house by a wooden gallery, at the center of the village. A working farm was close to the idyllic, fantasy-like setting of the Queen's Hamlet.
