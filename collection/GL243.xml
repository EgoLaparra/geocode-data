These graves are possibly those of the family of the founder of the church.[3] The church is Romanesque in style,[1] and largely unchanged since the Middle Ages. In the 1880s, plans were made to enlarge the church but the congregation failed to raise enough money to execute the plans.[3] It has a rectangular nave, a shorter and lower choir and an apse.[1]

Instead, the church tower may have been erected as a funerary monument by a local nobleman (who may be the subject of a much-faded fresco inside the church). He may have participated in the Crusades or gone on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and erected the tower as a symbol of his connection to <link wikipedia="Jerusalem" osm="29090735 1381350 6502363" type="node relation relation">Jerusalem</link>.[2]

This influx cemented the image of the neighborhood for the decades that followed as both primarily white and working-class.[3][4] For many years it was an isolated community. Hampden was once known as a "Little Appalachia" or a "hillbilly ghetto." Before, during, and after World War II many Appalachian migrants settled in Baltimore, including Hampden. Appalachian people who migrated to Hampden were largely economic migrants who came looking for work.[5]

A grand jury indicted the county commissioners in 1869 for official misconduct since the courthouse did not have fireproof storage for the registry of deeds and the safekeeping of public records. This forced the county to build a new courthouse.[2]

The Hampton Down ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3,300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites, with the stones perhaps having supernatural associations for those who built the circles. However, it has been suggested that the site is not a stone circle at all, but is instead made up of kerbstones from a Bronze Age round barrow.

The estate was owned by the Ridgely family for seven generations, from 1745 to 1948. The Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in America when it was completed in 1790 and today is considered to be one of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in the U.S.[2] Its furnishings, together with the estate's slave quarters and other preserved structures, provide insight into the life of late 18th-century and early 19th-century landowning aristocracy. In 1948, Hampton was the first site selected as a National Historical Site for its architectural significance by the U.S. <link wikipedia="National_Park_Service" osm="293087669" type="way">National Park Service</link>.[3] The grounds were widely admired in the 19th century for their elaborate parterres or formal gardens, which have been restored to resemble their appearance during the 1820s. Several trees are more than 200 years old.[4] In addition to the mansion and grounds, visitors may tour the overseer's house and slave quarters.

The city was conquered by the State of Qin after the virtual annexation of Zhao by Qin except for the Dai Commandery. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang was born in Handan, the child of a statesman from the state of Qin and after successfully conquering Zhao he ordered all enemies of his mother to be buried alive. The conquest of Zhao, particularly the Qin siege of Handan, is featured extensively in Chen Kaige's classic film, The Emperor and the Assassin.

The school traces its origins back to 1887, and moved to its current site in 1968. The School was formed as a result of the merger of two prep schools , Newells and Desmoor. Newells had to move to this site following a fire in which one pupil died. The staff and pupils of Desmoor then moved from Ewhurst in Surrey. Originally there were two headmasters, Captain Peter Hope-Lang and Mr McNeil, until Hope-Lang's death in 1970. For a time the school was also known as Newells and Desmoor School.

      <p id="GL243_497_001" num_links="2">Hanger Wood is an ancient woodland and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in the parish of Stagsden, <link wikipedia="Bedfordshire" osm="88082" type="relation">Bedfordshire</link> in the <link wikipedia="United_Kingdom" osm="838090640 62149" type="node relation">United Kingdom</link>. Situated approximately one kilometre east of the village of Stagsden, the 24.12 hectares (59.6 acres) woodland was declared a SSSI in 1988, being described by Natural England as "one of the best remaining examples of wet ash-maple woodland in Bedfordshire".[1][2]
The name "Hanger" comes from Old English/Anglo-Saxon term for "wood on a hill" or "wooded hill",[3][4] applied to Hanger Wood due to its situation on a northwest-facing slope of a narrow ridge.[1] Commenting on the wood's character, A. Simco said in 1984 that "It has been strongly influenced by the geology and topography of the area, particularly by the south-west/north-east boulder clay ridge along which the parish boundary runs."[3]
