The width of the waterfall changes with the season, usually 30 metres (98 ft) wide but increasing to 50 m (164 ft) during flood season. It has a height of over 20 m (66 ft). When the Yellow River approaches the Hukou Mountain, blocked by mountains on both sides, its width is abruptly narrowed down to 20–30 m (66–98 ft). The water's velocity increases, and then plunges over a narrow opening on a cliff, forming a waterfall 15 m (49 ft) high and 20 m (66 ft) wide, as if water were pouring down from a huge teapot. Hence it gets the name Hukou (literally, "flask mouth") Waterfall.

      <p id="GL244_065_002" num_links="3">During the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), Hulunbuir was part of the Liaodong Commandery.[1] During the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), Hulunbuir was part of <link wikipedia="Heilongjiang" osm="244080473 199073" type="node relation">Heilongjiang</link> province. The 1858 Treaty of Aigun established today's approximate Sino-Russian border, at a great loss to Heilongjiang's territory. In 1901, the Chinese Eastern Railway linked Hulunbuir to the rest of <link wikipedia="Northeast_China" osm="6636581109" type="node">northeast China</link> and to Russian Far East. From 1912-1949, during the Republic of China (ROC) period, Hulunbuir was part of Xing'an and <link wikipedia="Heilongjiang" osm="244080473 199073" type="node relation">Heilongjiang</link> provinces. A treaty between the Russian Empire and the ROC on November 7/October 24, 1915 designated Hulunbuir a "special" region under direct subordination to the Central Government of China, but in practice Russia had partial control over day-to-day administration. In 1929, the Soviet Union broke this agreement and invaded Hulunbuir.[2] After the Japanese invasion of China, Hulunbuir became part of the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo, which was not recognized by the Chinese. In the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Party of China gained the support of Inner Mongol leaders like Ulanhu by promising the irredentist expansion of Inner Mongolia into areas that had majorities of Han and Manchu peoples.[3]

As a Long Truss, the Hune Bridge is a valuable example of nineteenth-century architecture: few examples of this complicated style survive to the present day.[3]  In 1976, the Hune Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, both because of its place in local history and because of its historically significant construction.[1]

There were two sets of escalators. Small zigzag shaped waterfalls were at opposite ends of the mall. When Macy's closed the former space was split into Dick's and Burlington Coat Factory on the upper and lower floors, respectively, removing the elevators and escalators inside the store space. Once this happened the stairs at the mall entrance were replaced with escalators which remained in place after redevelopment. Hunt Valley's official mascot was Hunter the Valley Bear.[3]

Due mainly to an influx of residential development in the area, Huntsdale was reincorporated in February 2003 and its first elections were held two months later.[8][9] The center of activity in Huntsdale is Katfish Katy's, a small trail-side, seasonal restaurant along the Katy Trail State Park and features a small amphitheater and boat ramp. Katy's Little Lodge, formerly a bed and breakfast, was another notable business in the village.

It was manufactured by Intamin, consists of 5 cars around a central tube which is around 376 feet (115 m) tall. Riders are four abreast and are brought to a height of 330 feet (100 m) by a coupler. The car slowly tilts forward as it climbs the last few feet. As the camera flash goes off, the coupler detaches, letting riders freefall around 283 feet (86 m) at 71.46 miles per hour (115.00 km/h). The car then slowly drops back into the station. The ride and queues are intensively themed around a Mexican background, in order to fit in with the Mexico area of the park. Depending on which side of the tower the rider boards the ride experience differs greatly. Riders can either sit regularly, sit in tilting seats or ride standing, but without a floor.
