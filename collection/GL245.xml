Horvat 'Ethri (Hebrew: חורבת עתרי‎; alt. spellings: Hurvat Itri, Ethri, Atari), Hebrew for "Ethri Ruins", Arabic name: Umm Suweid ("mother of the buckthorns"), is a sprawling archaeological site that features the remains of a now partially restored Jewish village which dates back to the Second Temple period. The site sits upon an elevation of 406 metres (1,332 ft) above sea level, wherein are preserved an ancient synagogue, wine presses, cisterns, ritual baths and stone ossuaries, as well as an underground system of public hiding places.

The first Huskie was constructed in 1967 as a potential Canadian Centennial project by Jules Horvath and Bob Selway from Deluxe Signs and Displays under the direction of the Kenora Chamber of Commerce. Since then the effigy[citation needed] has received national recognition in part due to its size and position alongside the Trans-Canada Highway. The original was rebuilt in 1995.

The church in the 1500s was a stave church. At some point, the stave church had deteriorated and a new timber-framed church was built next to it.  In 1646, records show that both the old and new churches were still standing.  The timber-framed church was a cruciform design.  At some point, the old stave church was torn down.  In 1718, a lightning strike caused the church to burn down and it took 20 years before it was replaced.  In 1738, a new cruciform church was built on the same site.  The main part of the building measured 15.7 by 14.5 metres (52 ft × 48 ft).  In the 1870s, the church was found to be too small for the congregation, so it was torn down and a new, larger church was built in 1874.  The new church was built right outside the old cemetery which surrounded the old church.  The church bell and the brass baptismal font from the old 1738 church were saved and installed in the new church. The pulpit and the altarpiece were incorporated into the Sandvig Collections (Sandvigske Samlinger) at <link wikipedia="Maihaugen" osm="5440615" type="relation">Maihaugen</link> in <link wikipedia="Lillehammer" osm="412416" type="relation">Lillehammer</link>.[4][5]

For three months in 1826, it was known as New Store, but the name then returned to Hanging Fork. When the town was established on February 29, 1836, it was renamed Hustonville after two local landowners; the post office adopted the name the next year.[2] The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1850.[3]

In the years 1975-1998 the town was administratively part of the Krosno province.
Near the road to Tarnawa Górna, about 2.5 km from the village there is a monument in honor of 115 Poles brought here from the prison in Sanok and murdered by the Nazis on Mount Gruszka in 1940.
The poet Janusz Szuber wrote a poem entitled Huzele, published in the volume of poetry Fri. Bitter provinces from 1996 [7].   .
