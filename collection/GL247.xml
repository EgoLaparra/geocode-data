The town appears on that occasion to have received additional settlers.[2] The town, which appears to have occupied the whole of the little island, had only ten stadia in circumference; but it nevertheless acquired great wealth,[3] from its fisheries and trade in fish.[4] Iasos was a member of the Delian League and was involved in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC). After the Sicilian expedition of the <link wikipedia="Classical_Athens" osm="5688115" type="relation">Athenians</link>, Iasos was attacked by the <link wikipedia="Sparta" osm="5348685" type="relation">Spartans</link> and their allies; it was governed at the time by Amorges, a Persian chief, who had revolted from Darius II. It was taken by the Spartans, who captured Amorges and delivered him up to Tissaphernes. The town itself was plundered on that occasion. It became part of the Hecatomnid satrapy in the 4th century and was conquered by Alexander. We afterwards find it besieged by Philip V, king of Macedon, who, however, was compelled by the Romans to restore it to Ptolemy V of Egypt.[5] The mountains in the neighbourhood of Iasus furnished a beautiful kind of marble, of a blood-red and livid white colour, which was used by the ancients for ornamental purposes.[6] Near the town was a sanctuary of Hestia, with a statue of the goddess, which, though standing in the open air, was believed never to be touched by the rain.[7] The same story is related, by Strabo, of a temple of Artemis in the same neighbourhood. Iasus, as a celebrated fishing place, is alluded to by Athenaeus.[8] The place is still existing, under the name of Askem or Asýn Kalessi. Chandler (Travels in As. Min. p. 226) relates that the island on which the town was built is now united to the mainland by a small isthmus. Part of the city walls still exist, and are of a regular, solid, and handsome structure. In the side of the rock a theatre with many rows of seats still remains, and several inscriptions and coins have been found there.

He had two brothers, Hysni and Ali, both bearing titles hafiz and hadji. Ibrahim was an early childhood friend of Seremedin and Murat Toptani, with whom he kept close ties for the rest of hist life.[3] He studied theology in <link wikipedia="Istanbul" osm="1882099475 2895014424" type="node node">Istanbul</link>. There he came in contact with the activists of the Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights. He returned to Tirana where he started working as a teacher in 1901. At the same time he was a member of the local branch of the Bashkimi (Unity) Club, one of the many of that time throughout all Albanian populated areas. He participated in the Congress of Elbasan, during 2–9 September 1909, as part of the Tirana delegation.[3] One of the Congress's main achievement was the establishment of the <link wikipedia="University_of_Elbasan" osm="295658286" type="way">Normal School of Elbasan</link> which would prepare teachers for supporting the spread of Albanian education. He was imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities during 1909-1911 due to his nationalist activity.[1] On 26 November 1912, Dalliu was an active participant in the ceremony of raising the Albanian flag in Tirana, 2 days before the National Declaration of Independence. At the same time he drafted a letter-protest which was sent to the Serbian army approaching from the north.[3]
From April 25 to May 3, 1921, he took part in the Congress for National Unity in <link wikipedia="Vlorë" osm="33208756 1255534 1255543" type="node relation relation">Vlora</link>, together with Musa Maçi as representatives of the society "Lidhja Kombëtare" (National League), Qazim Mulleti of Tirana's society "Vllaznia-Zgjimi" (Brotherhood - Awakening), and <link wikipedia="Avni_Rustemi" osm="318665845" type="way">Avni Rustemi</link> for the society "Bashkimi" (Union). During the interbellum period, Dalliu focused on teaching, writing, and translation. He is remembered in Albanian as one of the few high rank clerics who were devoted to the national cause as well as to religion. He taught for many years at the Madrasa of Tirana and wrote many work and studies on Islam. He also wrote satirical poetry,[4] and published the newspaper Dajti (<link wikipedia="Dajti" osm="26863587" type="node">Dajt</link>).[5]
He was part of the <link wikipedia="Parliament_of_Albania" osm="256162012" type="way">National Assembly</link> in 1943.[6] With the rise of the communists in power in 1944, he was arrested and imprisoned due to his engagement in politics and some sharp anti-communist poetry he had written.[1] Dalliu died in jail on 25 May 1952, and was annihilated by the communist historiography.

</p>
      <p id="GL247_169_002" num_links="5">A true fjord is formed when a glacier cuts a U-shaped valley by ice segregation and abrasion of the surrounding bedrock.[6] According to the standard model, glaciers formed in pre-glacial valleys with a gently sloping valley floor. The work of the glacier then left an overdeepened U-shaped valley that ends abruptly at a valley or trough end. Such valleys are fjords when flooded by the ocean. Thresholds above sea level create freshwater lakes.[7] Glacial melting is accompanied by the rebounding of Earth's crust as the ice load and eroded sediment is removed (also called isostasy or glacial rebound). In some cases this rebound is faster than sea level rise. Most fjords are deeper than the adjacent sea; <link wikipedia="Sognefjord" osm="6166030" type="relation">Sognefjord</link>, <link wikipedia="Norway" osm="424297198 1059668 2978650" type="node relation relation">Norway</link>, reaches as much as 1,300 m (4,265 ft) below sea level. Fjords generally have a sill or shoal (bedrock) at their mouth caused by the previous glacier's reduced erosion rate and terminal moraine.[8] In many cases this sill causes extreme currents and large saltwater rapids (see skookumchuck). <link wikipedia="Saltstraumen" osm="925351629" type="node">Saltstraumen</link> in Norway is often described as the world's strongest tidal current. These characteristics distinguish fjords from rias (e.g. the <link wikipedia="Bay_of_Kotor" osm="2866926982" type="node">Bay of Kotor</link>), which are drowned valleys flooded by the rising sea. Drammensfjorden is cut almost in two by the <link wikipedia="Svelvik" osm="404603" type="relation">Svelvik</link> "ridge", a sandy moraine that during the ice cover was under sea level but after the post-glacial rebound reaches 60 m (200 ft) above the fjord.[9]

The islands off the west coast of southern Africa provide refuge from predators and Cape gannet (Morus capensis) and Cape cormorants (Phalacrocorax capensis) are the region's most abundant seabirds with tens of thousands on the islands during the nesting season. The birds guano also provide nutrients which flow into the surrounding sea when large waves hit the island or when it rains. The guano enriches the rocky shore with carpets of seaweed grazed by goat's-eye limpets, which are predated by spiny starfish.[2]

Nevertheless, samples taken in 2001 showed levels of phosphorus and nitrogen were moderate while levels of metals were increasing between the stream's origin and mouth.  The municipalities sharing the catchment area, together with the county administrative board have initiated various project to enhance the natural value of the river and the surrounding green areas.[2]  For example, in 2006 Solna and Sundbyberg declared their ambitions to transform the central part of the stream from a straight ditch to a meandering river murmuring over stones, overshadowed by trees and flanked by wetlands intended to attract amphibians and waders; a project partly financed by the Swedish state.[3]

The first church was established between 1568 and 1575, and dedicated to Saint Bartholomew; it is rumored to have been built on an indigenous burial ground. In 1613 a more permanent Franciscan mission and convent was established to convert the native Cot, Quircot, and Tobosí people; at this time, the church was rededicated to the Assumption of the Virgin, to remain its patron until 1888. In 1681, governor Miguel Gómez de Lara began on a new temple, also built of adobe, which was completed in 1693.On Feb. 15, 1772, an earthquake destroyed the convent and severely damaged the old church; however, it stood to the north of the current temple until it finally collapsed in an earthquake on December 12, 1888. In 1793, Barva was granted an independent parish. Construction of the current temple began in 1867, with the cornerstone laid by Monseñor Joaquín Anselmo Llorente, the first Bishop of Costa Rica; however, construction was halted by the 1888 earthquake which finally destroyed the old church. The temple was finally consecrated on August 11, 1893 by Bernardo Thiel Hoffman, the German-born second Bishop of Costa Rica, and re-dedicated back to St. Bartholomew.

Construction on the current building began towards the end of the colonial period. The cornerstone was laid on October 31, 1797, but the church was not completed until several years later; though the exact date is unknown, it is believed to have been completed in 1806. The façade was again reconstructed in 1851 when an earthquake brought it tumbling to the ground. Over the years, a baptistry and catechism school were added, while the church gardens were enlarged. The temple exhibits a simple, whitewashed, Spanish neoclassical exterior, while the relatively unadorned interior shows the humility and faith of the people who constructed it. On the front of the church, three niches once contained statues of saints created by the famous Heredian soldier, architect, and sculptor Fadrique Gutiérrez; today, only the central statue of <link wikipedia="Saint_Peter" osm="6450566915 6670542940" type="node node">St. Peter</link> remains.
