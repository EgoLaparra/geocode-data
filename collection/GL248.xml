      <p id="GL248_105_002" num_links="2">Hawthorne Boulevard was named after Dr. J.C. Hawthorne, the cofounder of Oregon's first mental hospital. Originally named "U" Street, the road was renamed Asylum Avenue in 1862.  In 1883 the privately owned Oregon Hospital for the Insane was replaced by a new state-run facility located in <link wikipedia="Salem,_Oregon" osm="150956539 186479" type="node relation">Salem</link>, today's <link wikipedia="Oregon_State_Hospital" osm="30264157" type="way">Oregon State Hospital</link>. East Portland residents considered the continued use of the street name Asylum Avenue after the closure of hospital "distasteful." The name was abandoned in April 1888 when the street was renamed Hawthorne Avenue by city ordinance in honor of Dr. Hawthorne.[3] It was renamed again in March 1933 to Hawthorne Boulevard.[4]

Originally constructed as part of the Norman invasion of Wales, the castle was designed as a ringwork overlooking the town in either the late-11th or early-12th centuries. It was rebuilt in stone around 1200 by the de Braose family and then had a turbulent history, being attacked and burnt several times during the First and Second Barons' Wars, the wars with the Welsh princes, the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr and the Wars of the Roses. In the 17th century a Jacobean mansion house was built alongside the medieval keep and the property became a private home. Serious fires in 1939 and 1977 gutted the castle and, despite repairs in the 1980s, by the 21st century much of the building was derelict and unstable. Since 2011 it has been owned by the Hay Castle Trust who plan to renovate the property to form an arts and education centre.

It is a stone temple and it enshrines an image of Hayagriva Madhava. Some Buddhists believe that the Hayagriva Madhava temple, best known in the group of Hindu temples, is where the Buddha attained Nirvana. At this imposing temple, the presiding deity is Vishnu, worshipped in the sanctum sanctorum as an idol carved of black stone. Four other stone idols are also in worship as subsidiary deities.

Since 1910, however, it has taken up its current usage, apart from the Second World War years when it was a POW camp for German and Italian prisoners. It was the second camp to fail to hold the famous German escapee Franz von Werra. The escape tunnel can still be seen at the conference centre. The centre is one of the larger employers in the area, with some employees having been with the company for over 30 years. The company has a policy of using local suppliers wherever possible, especially for fresh food, and generally to be eco-friendly.

Initially, it was a one-story building with a basement. As late as the 1960s, students still rode their horses to school and tied them to hitching posts. As the number of students exceeded the campus' limit, the site was expanded from 10 to 30 acres (120,000 m2). The architecture for the new buildings included ionic columns, low-pitched roofs, and friezes of goods. This building, built in 1911, lasted until Hayward High moved to its current campus in 1962, to make way for the City Center Building. Frederic Johnson was principal of the school from the 1911 opening to 1935.

It is located at the intersection of Eagleson Road and Hazeldean Road, where Hazeldean Road turns into Robertson Road.  It was the first enclosed shopping centre constructed in Kanata.  The development of the mall was approved shortly before the incorporation of the (then) City of Kanata, and its approval led to a legal battle between the constituent parts of the new municipality over the appropriate location of what would at that time be the new city's main commercial hub.[1]

</p>
      <p id="GL248_304_002" num_links="3">The site of the mall was zoned for commercial uses in 1962 at the time that the surrounding community of Glen Cairn was planned.[2] The "Glen Cairn Shopping Centre" proposal was approved in 1978 by <link wikipedia="Goulbourn_Township,_Ontario" osm="9245428 9246628" type="relation relation">Goulbourn Township</link>, only months before Glen Cairn ceased to be part of Goulbourn and was amalgamated with <link wikipedia="March_Township,_Ontario" osm="9246627" type="relation">March Township</link> and parts of <link wikipedia="Nepean,_Ontario" osm="9082082 9245438" type="relation relation">Nepean Township</link> into the new City of Kanata.  March Township Council initiated legal action, ultimately unsuccessful, to significantly reduce the size of the Glen Cairn Shopping Centre development on the grounds that it would adversely affect the market potential for March's own Kanata Town Centre development proposal.  March Township officials hoped that the Town Centre, located closer to the geographic centre of the new municipality than the Hazeldean Mall, would spur development of a new retail and office core for Kanata.[1][3]  The competing Town Centre project eventually obtained final approvals in 1980, after the Hazeldean Mall had opened.[4]

A smaller first castle was already built there in the late 13th century by the Lichtenburg noble family. Later, the site was home to the Zajíc family: in 1335, Zbyněk Zajíc, a powerful aristocrat during the times of Charles IV., purchased it, and made it the center of his estates. In Czech, the word zajíc means hare, so the name of castle and hill is a mediaeval play on the name of its most prominent owners, who even had hares in their coat of arms. Zbyněk Zajíc considerably enlarged and extended the castle, and in particular added the two prominent towers which survive to this day.

The village has at its disposal well developed infrastructure with educational and shopping facilities; the region's surrounding centres can in the main be reached within 20 minutes.

Haßloch is on the whole a continuous built-up area, although Haßloch's southeasternmost neighbourhood, the Wehlachsiedlung, lies somewhat apart from the main centre. Literally translated, the German name Hassloch means "Hate Hole".

The Heath Street line was discontinued on September 11, 1961.[3] Peak-hour service to the loop resumed on December 26, 1964; for a period in 1966, every other train on Huntington Avenue short-turned at the loop. Heath Street was the terminus of all weekday service (except nights) for three periods in 1977-78 due to streetcar shortages and track work.[3]
