      <p id="GL249_028_002" num_links="2">Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the area was populated by the people of the Chiribaya culture.  The Conquistadores were given land grants by Charles V and brought olives to this area.  Olive agriculture was the main crop and source of work until the early 20th century.  A small settlement, Pacocha, was established by the seashore where the Osmore River (Rio Osmore) flows into the Pacific Ocean. High tides in the late 19th century flooded Pacocha and the population moved to Ilo's actual location, adopting its current name. Until the beginning of the 20th century most of the people lived along the banks of the Rio Osmore, whose waters flow sporadically during the summer months. Ilo was a port of call to the ships travelling from the east to the west coast of the United States via <link wikipedia="Tierra_del_Fuego" osm="163703" type="relation">Tierra del Fuego</link>.

Earlier, during the Tsardom of Russia, Qaradonlu belonged to the Javad Khan administration.
The Qaradonlu region is situated in a favourable area near the <link wikipedia="Aras_(river)" osm="108576252 3102817" type="way relation">Aras River</link> providing water resources, productive land and caravan roads.
As early as the October Revolution, land-reclamation and irrigation work were made based on the intense irrigated plant-growing.
In 1906, the first School of Qaradonlu region was established, with many living-buildings, caravanserais, mills and shops in the area.
In 1933, Qaradonlu Machine-Tractor Plant was built in the Qaradonlu historical region.
As a result of the construction of the railway between Ələt and <link wikipedia="Yerevan" osm="130040361 364087" type="node relation">Yerevan</link>, people moved from the center of region to suburbs of the railway stations.
The population increase motivated two-story brick buildings to be built among the Qaradonlu and Imishli villages, so the capital of the region was moved to here and the region was considered <link wikipedia="Imishli_District" osm="3764590" type="relation">Imishli Rayon</link>.
Imishli village was rapidly expanded, much like the capital of the region.
Government houses were constructed, completely transforming the overall appearance of the village.
In 1944, Imishli was awarded status of town-type settlement, which progressed to city status in the 1960s.
In 1959, on the <link wikipedia="Aras_(river)" osm="108576252 3102817" type="way relation">Aras River</link> in the Bəhramtəpə area, water storage was used - which was unique to that time period.

      <p id="GL249_233_002" num_links="5">On 15 June 1868, the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway (Großherzoglich Badische Staatseisenbahnen) opened  the section of the Black Forest Railway between <link wikipedia="Engen,_Germany" osm="240102157 1104293" type="node relation">Engen</link> and <link wikipedia="Donaueschingen_station" osm="3750401727" type="node">Donaueschingen</link>. This included Immendingen station. Two years later on 26 July 1870, the Royal Württemberg State Railways (Königlich Württembergischen Staats-Eisenbahnen) inaugurated the 9.7 km-long route between Tuttlingen and Immendingen, the last piece of the Upper Neckar Railway, providing a continuous connection from Immendingen via Tübingen to <link wikipedia="Stuttgart" osm="1674026139 2793104" type="node relation">Stuttgart</link>. Immendingen was the stop for the change of operational responsibility between Baden and Württemberg. In 1873, Baden completed the last sections of the Black Forest Railway. It also opened the ten-kilometre section from <link wikipedia="Tuttlingen_station" osm="3181548204 303813841" type="node way">Tuttlingen</link> junction on 26 November 1890, completing the Danube Valley Railway to Ulm via Sigmaringen. The line from Ulm to Sigmaringen had been completed in 1873. Under the treaty for the construction of Danube Valley Railway between Baden and Württemberg that had been concluded on 22 May 1875, Württemberg was responsible for the operation of the line, part of which ran through Baden territory. The section of the line from Immendingen junction to the junction with the Wutach Valley Railway at the neighbouring Hintschingen station was  put into operation for military reasons on 20 May 1890, a few months before the completion of the Danube Valley Railway, with trains generally running from or to Immendingen. This made Immendingen station one of the most important railway junctions between Offenburg and Konstanz. Trains between Stuttgart and <link wikipedia="Zürich" osm="240025182 1682248" type="node relation">Zurich</link> had to terminate and reverse at the station at the station and at the same time responsibility for operations was transferred between the Württemberg and the Baden railways. The station therefore had a locomotive depot of the Württemberg State Railways and a maintenance facilities for Baden locomotives.

In 1869 the two steelworks were reunited with the company.[4]
In 1954 the company was renamed the Société métallurgique d'Imphy.
In 1968 it was merged with the Société des forges et aciéries du Creusot, which in 1971 became Creusot-Loire.[3]

It uses LIMs to launch a train out of the station and (in most installations) up a vertical spiral. The train then falls backwards, is powered again through the station, and heads up a back tower. The train then falls forwards, and continues in this fashion for a total of 2½ cycles per ride (three forward launches, two backwards). On the final forward launch, with a slightly reduced speed, the train is sent up the front tower, and brakes then deploy on the launch track. The train then slows down and heads back into the station.

After a few more cycles, the train slowed down and came to a stop in the station. It closed on October 31, 2010.[1]

In one tube, there's an overwhelming smell of chocolate chip cookies as the scene is referencing Jack-Jack's obsession with chocolate chip cookies in Incredibles 2. Additionally, if you look carefully, you will notice that the tubes open up toward Pixar Pier so people in the park can see riders moving through the coaster. However, the backside of these tubes are closed in order to meet sound code in Orange County, California. The screams of delight of riders will be projected toward the park and away from the rest of the city of <link wikipedia="Anaheim,_California" osm="1837296118 253985" type="node relation">Anaheim</link> and neighboring <link wikipedia="Garden_Grove,_California" osm="1837289828 5983303" type="node relation">Garden Grove</link>.

The area's mining history dates to at least 1897, when active claims were reported in the vicinity of Fishook Creek.  These early mining efforts were eventually joined to form the Wasilla Mining Company, which worked the mines from 1934 to 1943, and again from 1948 to 1950.  The mining operation at Independence was the second-largest hard-rock gold mining operation in the state, after a larger site near <link wikipedia="Juneau,_Alaska" osm="150918835 2605281" type="node relation">Juneau</link>.  The company and the miners that preceded it built a substantial mining camp, with as many as sixteen wood frame buildings, which were originally connected to each other by sheltered wooden "tunnels".  When the company ended operations in 1950, it had expected to eventually resume operations, but never did; this resulted in a particularly well-preserved collection of mining equipment and buildings, although the weather has since taken a significant toll on the latter.[2]
