As the uniting of Lutheran and Reformed Christians in Germany proceeded, some Lutheran groups dissented and formed independent churches, especially in Prussia, Saxony, Hanover and Hesse.  These Lutherans held that Reformed doctrine and Lutheran doctrine are contradictory on many points (especially on the nature of the Real Presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper), and that such doctrinal differences precluded altar fellowship. So in the 1820s and 1830s Lutherans in Prussia and their congregations formed a new Lutheran church, recognised by the king in 1845 as the Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Preußen (Evangelical Lutheran Church in Prussia). It was seated in <link wikipedia="Wrocław" osm="418392093 451516 2805690 2805691" type="node relation relation relation">Breslau</link> and presided over by the Oberkirchenkollegium (Supreme Church Collegial Body).

Mingo's nickname was changed from the Indians and the combined schools became the Indian Creek Redskins. Although both Wintersville and Mingo's High school voted for the colors to be black and blue, the executive decision was made by the school board to go with Gold and Red against the populus of the two communities.

The park is located on 3 acres (1.2 ha) in a natural depression north of East River Drive and to the west of a railroad trestle bridge.[3] The land was donated to the city in 1921 by Mrs. D.N. Richardson with the expressed purpose of creating a park.[4]  The property contains a spring that was used by Native Americans, from which the park derives its name, as well as early travelers and the areas first settlers.  The spring itself was capped in 1929 and a pipe 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter directs the water into a storm drain.[4]  During the high water season in the spring the park's basin fills with spring water and shore birds return to nest.  The park, which is largely undeveloped,[5] has served as a play area for the neighborhood children, students from neighboring Hoover Elementary School, and later the day care that is housed there.  The park is a contributing property in the Village of East Davenport Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  It was added to the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 2005.

Indian Trail was first a farming community; however, German and Scot-Irish settlers began to move into the area due to its geographical location.

Indian Trail has grown rapidly in the 21st Century: a 2011 CNN article stated that Indian Trail's census count jumped from 1,942 in 1990 to 33,518 in 2010.[4] Every Fourth of July the town holds an annual parade which is one of the biggest parades in the Charlotte metropolitan area.

A new high school, Shadow Hills in the northern half of Indio will decrease the number of students in the 2009/10 school year.[5] In the 2009/10 school year Desert Sands was deciding whether to close the school at the end of the 2009/10 school year, due to low Standardized Test scores. That year the scores went up dramatically and the board instead voted to renovate the school, which was approved. The School was featured in a video for success 101, a course for freshmen entering high school to help them transition from middle to high school. Freshman students, faculty, and teachers of the 2010/11 school year were followed all school year to see how the class had helped them.[6] For the 2011/12 school year the school moved from a six-period day schedule to an eight-period A/B Block schedule. This was done to give the students more electives and also so they would have opportunities to get more credits. On May 1, 2013 at 8:52, there was a fire at the boy's locker room coaches office. Firefighters took out the fire in about a half an hour.[7]

The IBx program was established to provide an alternative to the normal routing to Garfield High School, for the highly capable students.

The Ofa war resulted from the desire of Ilorin-fulani to avenge their defeat at the Jalumi on Ofa and the neighboring towns(The war was fought during the reign king of Oba Oloyede Ojo, Otepola 1. They laid siege on Ofa for several years before Ofa was eventually sacked around 1890. The Daparu war resulted from the sack and fall of Ofa. The Fulani now desired to sack all the towns and villages between Ofa and Osogbo and bring them under the rule of the Fulani of Ilorin. They continued to attack, raid and wage wars on the people. Only Inisa was brave and courageous enough to face the Fulani forces, as the other towns and villages were deserted, seeking refuge at Ibadan war camp in Ikirun.
