As part of the planned development, St. Paul expanded the original street, Edsel Avenue, and renamed it Ford Parkway.  The bridge project was designed by a committee of politicians and engineers from both Minneapolis and St. Paul and chaired by Charles M. Babcock, Minnesota's first commissioner of highways.  The development that was expected as a result of the bridge did not materialize, however, because of the Great Depression and growth in Minneapolis neighborhoods on the opposite side of the bridge.  It was not until after <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link> that the desired growth in the Highland Park area resulted from the bridge.[1]

After these two years, students will begin the International Baccalaureate program, which lasts for two years. All IB students will have to complete 150 'CAS' hours (creativity, action, service) throughout the two IB years. After all four years are completed, students will partake in several IB exams in order to receive their IB diploma. The students at the IAM get an understanding of the world through many great books, including Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, The Odyssey by Homer, and The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.[3] Although it is an IB school, the IAM is still considered a public school, but it requires students to pass a test and get drawn in a lottery to become enrolled.[4] There is no tuition required for students, but there is an initial $150 fee that will cover computer fees. Each student will receive his or her own laptop that will be used throughout the four years at the IAM, and any damage can usually be fixed with a re-imaging, including physical damage to the laptop.

      <p id="GL251_220_003" num_links="2">“Centro di Cultura e Civiltà Contadina” - Biblioteca Internazionale “La Vigna” was established by Demetrio Zaccaria. He was an entrepreneur from Vicenza who began to get interested in the field  after having read a book about oenology in <link wikipedia="New_York_City" osm="61785451 575213527 175905" type="node way relation">New York City</link> in 1951. It took twenty years to build an international library for researchers and connoisseurs. Dictionary of Wine by Frank Schoonmaker was the first book that was bought. Demetrio Zaccaria took part in international meetings,  maintained important connections worldwide and started to buy ancient and rare books. Particularly important was the meeting with André Simon in London. André Simon, wo was the founder of the International Wine and Food Society, author of important books about gastronomy and wine, as well as a leading figure in the Champagne commerce worldwide, became a model to follow for Demetrio Zaccaria.  
In the early seventies Zaccaria left Toscolano, on the <link wikipedia="Lake_Garda" osm="8569" type="relation">Lake Garda</link>, where he had lived since 1958, and moved permanently to Vicenza with his collection of books. In 1980 he bought  Palazzo Brusarosco which is the base of the present library. The following year, when he was seventy, he donated the palace and his collection of almost 10.000 books to the “Comune di Vicenza”. He did this because he was worried about the future of his collection and also because he tried in vain to find another settlement. He became general secretary of  “Centro di Cultura e Civiltà Contadina” and of the International Library “La Vigna”. Demetrio Zaccaria died in 1993 after having received important international recognitions.
