Before Hussey industrialized the coal operations of the town it was exploited by the locals, but without means to export the coal it was never mined in earnest. Hussey was able to secure financial backing from European investors and soon dredged a portion of the sand dunes to connect MacIsaac's Pond to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. He had some piers and wharves built, laid a small railway and was able to ship coal to export markets[2]. Hussey's operations were profitable but ten years later his infrastructure fell into disrepair and he sold off his interests.[citation needed]

There has been a castle at this site for many centuries. The castle is not currently open to the public, however a recent campaign has led to the creation of a working group to explore the possibility of doing so in the future.[1] In April 2017 the north tower of the castle was opened to the public as a view point.  At present, only the castle grounds and the north tower are open to the public.

The origins of the castle cannot be clearly dated. The first written evidence dated 1511[1]  – at this time already a possession of a relative of the barons Reich von Reichenstein. This noble family hold fiefdoms from the Prince-Bishopric of Basel, the Margraviate of Baden and the House of Habsburg.  A Prince-bishop of Basel, six mayors of Basel and a principal of Basel University came from this noble family. In 1394  Margrave Rudolf III. enfeoffed Heinrich Reich von Reichenstein with the right for high justice regarding the village of Inzlingen and afterwards the family was in a position to acquire also a substantial landholding within this village and named themselves Lords of Inzlingen.
A first major conversion of the castle dated 1563 to 1566.  A copper engraving published 1625 shows the buildings at this time. Later (1674 to 1745) the buildings were converted to a Baroque style and in about 1750 a Baroque interior (Stucco; Overdoor; Masonry heater) followed.

It was determined to organize a town company, which was immediately done, and a constitution was then adopted and officers elected.

Widely seen as masterpieces of the <link wikipedia="Romanian_language" osm="4933644467" type="node">Romanian language</link> and local humor, his writings occupy the middle ground between a collection of folkloric sources and an original contribution to a literary realism of rural inspiration.

From there, the settlers could migrate to the fertile land of Ipojuca rich in massapê.

When the Dutch invaded Pernambuco, several mills had already been established in the region. Many people in the city participated in resisting the Dutch. Under the leadership of Captain-mor Amador de Araújo, a battle broke out on July 17, 1645. The Dutch were defeated on July 23, 1645. After the victory over the Dutch, Ipojuca became one of the most important regions of the Colonial System.

The town that emerged was centered on the village of Nossa Senhora do Ó, and then was transferred to the village of San Miguel de Ipojuca.

Several hundred colonists sailed from England in 1630 in a fleet of 11 ships, including Winthrop's flagship, the Arbella. Investigating the region of <link wikipedia="Salem,_Massachusetts" osm="158853736 9396968" type="node relation">Salem</link> and Cape Ann, they entertained aboard the Arbella for a day, June 12, 1630, a native chief of the lands to the north, Chief Masconomet.[2] The event was recorded in Winthrop's journal on the 13th, but Winthrop did not say how they overcame the language barrier. The name they heard from Masconomet concerning the country over which he ruled has been reconstructed as Wonnesquamsauke, which the English promptly rendered into the anglicized "Agawam".

It was replaced by a cast-iron tower, while by 1867 the front light, Ipswich Front Range Light, had been replaced by a movable wood structure that could be shifted as the channel shifted. The front light was discontinued in 1932 and the rear light was replaced in 1938 with a skeleton tower.  It, or its replacement, is still in service today.

The surface water area fluctuations from 10–55 square kilometres (3.9–21.2 sq mi) while the authigenic catchment area measures 406 square kilometres (157 sq mi).[5]

The lake is located in a basin bounded by the Paitchau Mountains, within the Lospalos plateau. The region has <link wikipedia="Karst" osm="385649811" type="way">karstic</link> formations of limestone, with dolines, blind valleys, caves and springs. Ira Lalaro has an average water spread area of 1,900 hectares (4,700 acres), which varies from 1,000–5,500 hectares (2,500–13,600 acres). It is in a high plateau depression at an elevation of 334 metres (1,096 ft) "formed by a huge polje karst formation".
The lake flows to the east and as the lake water recedes during the dry season the land exposed becomes a pasture or scrubby grassland.[8]
The lake basin is surrounded by tropical dry forest which is of biodiversity value. The Irasiquero River, which originates from Lake Ira Lalaru, disappears in the main sink hole, the Mainina, about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) downstream of the lake outlet, and does not re-appear; tracer studies indicate that the underground route of water flow leads to the coast.

It was a collection of tents and shanties in the immediate vicinity of Ira Yates's ranch. Yates donated 152 acres (0.62 km2) of his ranch to the town of Iraan to encourage further development there, and in 1952, the town of Redbarn, which never had a permanent population more than 75, was finally abandoned.[5]

The name "Sandwich Bay", for John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, was given to the whole embayment between Cape Vahsel and Cape Charlotte in 1775 by a British expedition under James Cook. The name was later restricted on maps to the small bay described, since a name for the large embayment was not considered useful. The South Georgia Survey, 1951–52, reported that the name Iris Bay for the same feature is well established in use among the whalers and sealers in South Georgia, and that the name Sandwich Bay is unknown locally, so Iris Bay was approved to conform with local usage.[1]

The Iron Gate Dam along with the John C.

The original Mill, built in 1814 by William Arnold, later burned and was rebuilt by David and Seth Southwick in the 1850s. It burned again, and all that remains is the cellar hole. Historic photos remain and are published in a book "Uxbridge, Images of America", by Mae Edwards Wrona, published in 2000, by Arcadia, Tempus Publishing Inc, p56. The mill is a forerunner of America's Industrial Revolution which began here in the Blackstone Valley in 1793 with Samuel Slater and his mill, at <link wikipedia="Pawtucket,_Rhode_Island" osm="158815340 191212" type="node relation">Pawtucket, Rhode Island</link>.

Several other sites for the county seat were examined, and in 1839 it was moved to Middleport; a court house and jail were built there.  There was a long battle between Middleport and Watseka (also known as South Middleport) as to which should be the county seat; in 1865, it was finally moved to Watseka.[6]  The town of Middleport no longer exists, but there is a township of that name.  A courthouse was built in Watseka in 1866 at a cost of $28,000 and included a jail in the basement; this building was expanded in 1881, and a new jail was built in 1893 just east of the courthouse.[7]
