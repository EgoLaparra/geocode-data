In June 2014, Highline's board of trustees voted to change the name back to Highline College.[7] Starting in the fall of 2014, Highline was approved to offer four Bachelor of Applied Science degree programs.[8] Classes are also offered at the Marine Science and Technology (MaST) Center at <link wikipedia="Redondo,_Des_Moines,_Washington" osm="7510627" type="relation">Redondo Beach</link> and additional service-area locations such as <link wikipedia="Burien,_Washington" osm="150937401 237342" type="node relation">Burien</link> and <link wikipedia="White_Center,_Washington" osm="150941204 237341" type="node relation">White Center</link>.[9]

It was a tall two-span Warren truss bridge, formerly carrying two-lane <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_79" osm="23149" type="relation">U.S. Route 79</link> (US 79), a major arterial highway in the region, across the <link wikipedia="White_River_(Arkansas–Missouri)" osm="2184038" type="relation">White River</link> just west of the city's downtown. The steel truss had a total length of 720 feet (220 m), set on four concrete piers. The outer pairs of piers were 160 feet (49 m) apart, and the middle pair were 400 feet (120 m) apart. The approaches were concrete, set on concrete pilings, with the western approach continuing for some 3 miles (4.8 km) across secondary water bodies. The bridge was built in 1930-31 by the Austin Bridge Company.[2]

The bridge was built at a time when standards for concrete bridges had not yet been set.  It has three spans with an overall length of 80 feet (24 m) and a width of 19 feet (5.8 m).  It was built as part of a general construction plan to improve the road system in <link wikipedia="St._Francis_County,_Arkansas" osm="1818429" type="relation">St. Francis County</link>, and originally carried Highway B-1, which was later redesignated Arkansas Highway 1.

It is situated north of Coventry city centre, and has undergone a series of name changes throughout its history originally called "Harnall" and has seen itself change from a village, to a remote suburb, to a large postwar redevelopment zone. Hillfields has always welcomed immigrants of all nationalities. Originally the Irish communities and then the Indian-sub continent and west Indian communities settled in the mid 20th century. The area declined in the early 90s however in recent times a wave of new immigrants from Northern Iraq (Kurdistan) Iran as well as various people's from Africa have settled and have invested into the area and now the area is a lively neighbourhood bustling with shops and restaurants selling intercontinental produce and cuisine. Hillfields used to be home to Coventry City Football Club on Highfield Road until the club relocated to the <link wikipedia="Ricoh_Arena" osm="1832945" type="relation">Ricoh Arena</link>.
