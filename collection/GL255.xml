The bridge is a good example of Theodore Burr's 1814 patented truss design that employs multiple kingposts. Patent bridges were the "bread and butter" of early engineers who typically received one dollar per linear foot of bridge construction for use of the patented design.[2]

      <p id="GL255_026_003" num_links="2">Hillsboro Point was designated as hazardous for the safe navigation of ships in 1855 and federal designation was sought.[3] A request for a lighthouse at the inlet was first made in 1884.[4] The request was repeated yearly and rejected 17 times.[3][4] In 1901, the United States Lighthouse Board persuaded Congress to authorize the construction of a lighthouse in the dark area between <link wikipedia="Jupiter_Inlet_Light" osm="552218629" type="way">Jupiter Inlet Light</link> and <link wikipedia="Fowey_Rocks_Light" osm="6813442868" type="node">Fowey Rocks Light</link>. The official order approved on February 12, 1901 called for a "first-order light at or near Hillsboro Point...at a cost not to exceed $90,000."[3] No appropriation of funds was made in 1901 and in 1902 $45,000 was appropriated.[4] The full funding to build the lighthouse was appropriated on March 3, 1903.[3] Initially a site on the south side of the inlet was selected, however it was not feasible, so a site on the north of the inlet was chosen.[3][4] The owner of the property did not want to sell at first but after beginning condemnation proceedings, an agreement to purchase the land was reached.[4] The 3 acre (1.2 ha) parcel was purchased for $150 from Elnathan T. Field and Mary W. Osborn of Middleton, New Jersey who had bought the land for 70 cents an acre (0.4 ha) from the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund.[3][4][Note 1]
