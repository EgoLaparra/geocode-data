In the 1000 single-home housing development,[7] the theme included designs reminiscent of "Billy the Kid, Geronimo, Stagecoach Station, Betsy (the play), Big Bear, etc.".[6] Smith had researched various resort locations including Martha's Vineyard; <link wikipedia="Vail,_Colorado" osm="106849952 33153755" type="node way">Vail, Colorado</link> and then eventually Jackson Hole and chose the latter for the design and theme of the resort town.[8]  In Smith's research she "gathered cowhide, antler chandeliers, saddle blankets, lodge pole chairs, wagon wheels, Navajo rugs, iron light fixtures, wildlife scene fireplace screens, wooden snowshoes, leather throw pillows, horseshoes, Charles Russell prints and plaid curtains, shipping them all to China."[9] Liu Xiangyang who is the Developer of the Community, says his selling point is more than architecture; his buyers want freedom and spirituality, so he has built a Christian church in the center of the community for residents. While the resort community's reception varies widely, its striking resemblance to its namesake Western town has raised concerns in academic circles over the possibility of American neocolonialism. In August 2018, Dr. Jåcobs pointed to the Chinese town as evidence that the most pernicious forms of governmental and societal control exist in the actions of capitalistic expatriates.[10]

A mob of men assassinated Smith while he was in jail, resulting in the succession crisis. Hamblin supported Brigham Young, the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, as President of the Church. Following growing anti-Mormon sentiment around Nauvoo, Hamblin migrated west with Young on the Mormon Trail.

He would later recollect that "Roger Revelle's dream of building a State University with emphasis on distinguished graduate work had immediate appeal for me because it was consonant with what [he] had become familiar at the California Institute of Technology."[4] These recruits included the second and third chairs of the department, John W. Miles and Eric Reissner. During Miles' tenure, the department would be renamed to the Department of Applied Mechanics and Engineering Sciences, distinguishing it from the second engineering department.[4] Founded in 1965 by Henry G. Booker as the Department of Applied Electrophysics, it would be renamed the Department of Applied Physics and Information Science.[4] Both departments quickly achieved international acclaim for the high-quality research they supported. Additionally, undergraduate engineering instruction began in 1968 with a BA degree in information and computer science.[5]

Inmates were usually killed by being pushed into deep ravines located near the camp. Estimates of the number of deaths at Jadovno range from 10,000 to 68,000, mostly Serbs. The camp was closed on 21 August 1941, and the area where it was located was later handed over to the Kingdom of Italy and became part of Italian Zones II and III.
