As of the 2010 census, the town population was 24,661, over 2½ times its population in 2000.[4] The town was originally constructed around the fresh water springs from which it is believed its name is derived. It continued to grow slowly through the 1800s until the civil war where it regressed back to a ghost town, being described in 1871 as a 'deserted village'. The economic revival of the town began in 1875 when a successful mercantile business moved to Holly Springs. Holly Springs then was officially established as a town in 1877, after George Benton Alfred, the owner of the mercantile business, pushed for a town charter. World War I and II did not treat the town well with many young men leaving to fight, leading to population stagnation. In recent history the town has experienced a population boom due to in part the increase in population in neighbouring Cary and Apex. The town now looks set for steady economic and population growth for the foreseeable future.

</p>
      <p id="GL258_067_002" num_links="2">Excavation of the hillfort in 1929 by classicist and amateur archeologist S. E.

Later research, however, suggests that the fort was occupied earlier from 100 to 70 BC[3].  The fort was defended by double ramparts to the west and north with escarpments on the eastern and southern slopes. The outer ditches were originally about three metres deep and six metres wide. The inner ditches were considerably larger, some four metres deep and nine metres wide.  These earthworks may have had a symbolic function in addition to a purely military one.  The hard band of chert on which the hill fort sits gives it a prominence over the <link wikipedia="Weald" osm="2066141" type="relation">weald</link> that may have served as an assertion of control and security over the trade routes through the area.  There is no evidence to suggest long-term occupation of the fort but it would have offered a safe and obvious place to meet, trade and host communal activity [4].

Holmesburg was named for the descendants of Judge John Holme (1632–1704) who immigrated to Philadelphia in the 1680s and had no apparent relation to Surveyor General Thomas Holme. John Holme's descendants acquired land in Lower Dublin, north and south of Frankford Avenue and west of the Pennypack Creek. At the turn of the 19th century they began selling numerous small parcels of their holdings in what became a real estate boom. Also at this time, John Holme, the great grandson of the first John Holme, renamed his lumber yard the Holmesburg Lumber Yard. This renaming coupled with the multitude of Holme family real estate transactions identified this area as 'Holmesburg', the title surviving more than two hundred years later.

In 1905, Hauser and other directors of the Missouri River Power Company formed the Helena Power Transmission Company (also known as the "Helena Power and Transmission Company").[8] The two companies merged on February 16, 1906, to form the United Missouri River Power Company.[9] The merged company completed Hauser Dam on February 12, 1907.[10] The dam was a steel dam built on masonry footings on top of gravel, with the ends of the dam anchored in bedrock on either side of the river. On April 14, 1908, Hauser Dam failed after water pressure undermined the masonry footings (the steel dam itself being structurally sound).[10][11] United Missouri River Power began reconstruction of Hauser Dam in July 1908 (completing the dam in the spring of 1911).[10]

This looting had revealed large masks sculpted onto the side of one of the principal structures at the site. Holtun is the southernmost site in the Maya lowlands that is known to have such masks.[3] The site is characterized by the presence of two particular architectural groups, consisting in a triadic acropolis and an E Group, which are markers of the sociocultural complexity of the Preclassic period in the Lowland Maya area. In addition, the nature of the <link wikipedia="Karst" osm="385649811" type="way">karstic</link> bedrock allowed for the creation of a great quantity of chultuns, which can be found in almost all of the architectural groups [4]

The Congregation conducted services in members' homes and founded the <link wikipedia="Pape_Avenue_Cemetery" osm="180186005" type="way">Pape Avenue Cemetery</link>, Toronto's first Jewish cemetery. The congregation was known as the Daytshishe Shul because of its modern services. In 1856, Lewis Samuel, a Jewish immigrant from York, England arrived in Toronto along with 17 Jewish families from England and Europe and helped them organize the Sons of Israel Congregation.[1] In 1858, the two congregations merged to form the Toronto Hebrew Congregation-Holy Blossom Temple.[2] The <link wikipedia="Ontario_Heritage_Trust" osm="117233727" type="way">Ontario Heritage Foundation</link> lists Holy Blossom as the first Jewish congregation in Canada, west of the Ontario/Quebec border.[3] The first Holy Blossom Synagogue (1897) of Toronto was a new Judeo-Egyptian style templelike building with a front of cut stone, and adorned with a portico with two columns combining intricately detailed stone craftsmanship with Byzantine influences.

From 1884 on, the church ran a parish school. The church was closed after the Germans entered to Kaunas during World War I. As soon as Lithuania regained independence, the new government confiscated all the Orthodox churches in Kaunas, regarding them as signs of intensive Russification, leaving only the smallest one - the Holy Resurrection Church - in the hands of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1923 the church was renovated and reconsecrated by the Lithuanian Orthodox metropolitan Elevferiy (Bogojavlensky).

The cave is largely  associated with the Xibalba legend. The archaeologist Wolfgang Haberland performed studies in the late 1970s indicating the art belongs to the pre-Classic stage of Mesoamerican civilization.[1][2] The cave likely got its name due to the Mesoamerican association of caves with the underworld, meaning that they are "considered an entrance to the underground world governed by spirits and deities of death, disease, water, and fertility." [3] The cave  is an important cultural and religious site for the Lenca nation, forming part of their traditions and legends of the place where ancestors of Balam Colop parted (which is mentioned in the Popol vuh), according to their legends and traditions, is father of all Lenca people, given the association of caves with the underworld by Mesoamericans, the name of 'Holy Spirit Cave' is ironic and perhaps an attempt by early Spanish to "exorcise" the cave in El Salvador. The "holy" nature of this cave is further confirmed by a man named Don Argelio Alvarez, who happens to be one of its guardians. Roughly translated, he claims that the cave contains "something magical and inexplicable that inspires tranquility and peace." [4] Many people from various religious groups also continue to visit the site and carry out ceremonies, such as what Don Argelio believed to have taken place in the cave many centuries ago. However, it is entirely possible that the cave was instead used for other means. A German scientist found some handcrafted arrows and knives made of obsidian within the cave, leading him to believe that it may have actually been a shelter for hunters instead.[5]

Jefferson County's first Methodists were present by the 1780s, appearing in Richard Butler's journal during an expedition to remove squatters from Indian country in 1785.  Methodist preachers were active in Steubenville during 1794; a circuit had been formed by 1796, and a separate congregation was formed before long.  When Francis Asbury visited Steubenville to preach in 1803, he observed that their usual meeting place, <link wikipedia="Jefferson_County_Courthouse_(Ohio)" osm="368151985" type="node">the courthouse</link>, was too small to hold everyone.[2]:402  Several years passed before this problem was resolved; some members formed a separate congregation nearby in 1810, and wealthy member Bezaleel Wells donated land at the corner of Fourth and South Streets in Steubenville upon which a church was ready for use by the end of 1811.  Epidemics carried away many in 1813, but the numbers continued to swell as revival meetings won numerous converts,[2]:403 and while the new building was complete by 1814, an expansion was necessary as early as 1821.[2]:404  By 1824, the church was larger than any other in Steubenville, but the coming of New Light preachers caused a split, as the newcomers won away many Methodists.[2]:342  Membership stood at 178 in 1830, but 82 members left during the national schism that produced the Methodist Protestant Church in that year, and an epidemic of scarlet fever killed many younger members in the following year.[2]:404  Nevertheless, the congregation eventually began to regain its strength; the members living in northern Steubenville became a separate congregation in 1845, but eleven years later, the original building was replaced with a larger structure that was expanded in 1871.  Further church planting was conducted in 1867 and 1870, but by 1910, membership was approximately 650.[2]:405  Consequently, the present building was constructed on the same site in 1914.[1]
