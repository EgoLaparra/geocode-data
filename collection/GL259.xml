It is the oldest active cemetery in Helena and the oldest active European ethno-religious cemetery in Montana.[2][3] There are three major sections of land owned by the Association: the cemetery, undeveloped adjacent land, and land leased to the Helena School District since 1975. The portion leased by the school district is a practice football field for <link wikipedia="Capital_High_School_(Helena,_Montana)" osm="160059552" type="way">Capital High School</link> and contains unmarked graves from the earliest days of the cemetery. The original wrought iron fence erected in 1867 still stands except on the north side and is in disrepair in places. A granite gateway erected in 1910 is at the main entrance. The east gate also has granite markers. There is a water tower, pump house, and landscaping shed. Twelve broken tombstones lie at the base of the water tower. The northwest corner has remained undeveloped and in its natural wild state. In 1910 cottonwood trees were planted along the driveway.[2]

A large portion of the ranch comprised portions of the old G4 Ranch (named after Survey Block G4), established by John and Clarence Gano in the 1880s. Wilson's ranch focused on sheep and goats, the first such large operation in the Big Bend area.[2]  Wilson continued to live at the ranch until his death in 1943; his family moved from the ranch the next year.

The island was originally created when G. A. Furgason, a developer of the Homosassa area, hired a dragline operator to create the island from a pile of rocks submerged during high tide in order to keep boats from running aground.  The island derives its name from the monkeys relocated to the island from the <link wikipedia="Homosassa_Springs_Wildlife_State_Park" osm="321225195" type="way">Homosassa Springs Wildlife Park</link> in the 1960s.  The monkeys were moved from the park due to their "problematic" behavior, including stealing candy, entering cars, and biting visitors. The river acts as a natural fence because the monkeys prefer not to swim.  Currently five spider monkeys inhabit the island, three of which are from the original relocation. The island contains a lighthouse, Cedar trees, and a monkey "playground". They are fed fresh fruit daily by staff members.

Businessman L. Honigsberger built the store in 1865, replacing the original store he built in 1861. The brick building was designed in the Neoclassical style. The store served Copperopolis during its first copper boom in the 1860s; however, an 1867 fire and declining copper production caused Copperopolis to lose most of its population and severely diminished the store's business. In 1905, the Honigsberger family sold the store to the Union Copper Mining Company, which became the Calaveras Copper Mining Company four years later. The company used the store as a warehouse during another copper boom in Copperopolis from 1909 to 1929. The store is one of only four extant buildings from Copperopolis' first copper boom in the 1860s.[2]

When West died in 1784, the house was purchased by the English banker Henry Hope (to whom Adam Smith dedicated The Wealth of Nations and whose family would later own and lend their name to the Hope Diamond) and it was presented as a wedding gift to his ward, James Watmough.

Ballou and the Practical Christians established the Hopedale Community based on Christian and socialist ideologies in 1842.  The utopian commune went bankrupt in 1856, and its assets were purchased by Ebenezer and George Draper, manufacturers of looms.[2] Various industries developed under the direction of the Draper brothers, including the Hopedale Machine Company and Hopedale Furnace Company.  The town was officially incorporated in 1886 when it separated from <link wikipedia="Milford,_Massachusetts" osm="158899628 1844177" type="node relation">Milford</link>. George Draper designed, paid for, and constructed the town hall, which is constructed of granite from Milford and sandstone, and was dedicated in 1887.[2]  The Unitarian church was another gift from the Drapers, and the Bancroft Memorial Library was a gift from a superintendent at the plant.[2]  The marble sculpture outside the library was paid for by the Drapers and shipped from Rome in 1904.[2] In 1905, women were granted permission to swim at the town beach.
