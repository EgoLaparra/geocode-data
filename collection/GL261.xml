The brick building's design features hexagonal bay windows, a metal cornice decorated with scrolls and dentils, and belt courses between floors on the east facade. The building was one of many hybrid commercial and residential buildings constructed in the area, the center of Chicago's Sicilian community in the early twentieth century, though most such buildings have since been demolished. In 1910, the parents of prominent Chicago lawyer and politician Victor A. Arrigo purchased the building; Arrigo lived in the building until his death in 1973.[2]

The city added a small recreational park adjacent to the lake which included a beach, bath houses, picnic sites with grills, and a shelter that is still used for functions to this day.

It was inaugurated on 23 April 1938. Since 2003, this has been the official name for the railway bridge between <link wikipedia="Aalborg" osm="2247730880" type="node">Aalborg</link> and Nørresundby, though often it is simply called the Railway Bridge.[1] Formerly known as the "Limfjordsbroen", there is a road bridge, <link wikipedia="Limfjordsbroen" osm="344608980" type="way">Limfjordsbroen</link>, of the same name. The bridge connects Aalborg–Frederikshavn Line with Randers Aalborg railway. It has a single track and has a maximum authorized speed of 60 km / h. The nine span bridge is 403 metres (1,322 ft) long and has a width of 5.7 metres (19 ft). It is a bascule bridge with a counterweight of 400 tonnes. The bridge opens 4,000 times a year, and there are 10,000 annual sailings under it. Until 1 January 1997, it belonged to DSB when DSB was split into DSB and Banedanmark. In 28 March 2012 the bridge was hit by a ship and damaged. The reason was a misunderstanding in the radio communication. The bridge was repaired and opened again for traffic on 29 April 2013.

The reservoir provided drinking water until the 1980s, when it was drained and abandoned for a larger reservoir at the Boonton Gorge.  Since that time, a mini-ecosystem has taken root behind the thick, 20-foot tall stone walls: trees, wildflowers, swans, great blue heron, peregrine falcons, and at the center a 6-acre (2.4 ha) lake. This urban wildlife preserve hosts numerous animal and plant species not otherwise found in an urban environment.[2][3][3][4][5][6][7] It was listed on the state and the federal registers of historic places in 2012.[1] Nearby Reservoir No. 1 was located on either side of Summit Avenue and has been demolished.[8]

      <p id="GL261_127_002" num_links="2">The situation for the education of girls in Jersey from the mid-19th century lagged behind provision for boys. <link wikipedia="Victoria_College,_Jersey" osm="207188789" type="way">Victoria College</link> had been opened for boys, on the pattern of English public schools, in 1852. The well-to-do and the élite classes continued to employ governesses or to send their daughters to schools in France or England; other classes relied on the existing elementary schools in Jersey. Jersey people of influence gathered at the Grove Place Wesleyan Chapel in Saint Helier on 28 November 1879 and decided to set up a limited liability company to further a plan to provide a college for girls in Jersey. The then Bailiff of Jersey, Sir Robert Pipon Marett, became patron of the enterprise and an advertisement appeared in the British Press and Jersey Times in June 1880 to announce the forthcoming opening of the new college in September of that year: "It is designed to give to the daughters of residents and others, at an extremely moderate rate, an education of the highest order. Its promoters have long felt there is a pressing need for such an institution in Jersey". The school was opened in September 1880 as Jersey Ladies' College, located at Adelaide House in Roussel Street, <link wikipedia="Saint_Helier" osm="2615659256 2371948" type="node relation">Saint Helier</link>. Girls were put in for Oxford and Cambridge Local Examinations and Matriculation of London University, and those who had studied in France were able to take the Brevet de capacité in Paris. In 1883 3 students achieved distinction in the Matriculation Examination of London University; the first ladies to have matriculated from Jersey.[3]

The railroad had at the initial construction of the railroad in 1854 called the stop "Trøgstad", but because of confusion with the town name Trøgstad in Østfold, the name was changed in 1897 to "Jessum". This name was used blasphemically, for example by military recruits who said they had passed through Bøn (town north of Jessheim) which sounds like "prayer" in Norwegian to Jessum, which could sound like Jesus. The priests in the area complained to the bishop who in 1900 brought the case up with the local council and suggested the form "Jessheim". The name was changed to "Jesseim". In 1920 the railroad changed the spelling to the current form, Jessheim.
