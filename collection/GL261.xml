The first building was extended between 1781 and 1788, and later expanded on over time. The actual building is dated to 1825 with the plans of José Toribio (son of Tomás Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaraní street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaraní and 25 de Mayo) and Julián Masquelez (1889).[1] The hospital has a temple, the Charity Chapel, built in Greek style by Miguel Estévez in 1798.[2]

It was located in the now Ponce Historic Zone at the northwest corner of Marina and Jobos streets in Ponce.[4] Between 1980 and 1983, the Ponce Municipal Government, seeking to relocate Hospital Tricoche to a more accessible and spacious quarters, built new facilities on Avenida Las Americas (PR-163). Once built, however, the government could not appropriate the necessary funds to equip and open its new hospital building and agreed to sell the new facility to the Hospital Dr. Pila corporation, which moved into the new facilities three years later.[5] In 1986, Hospital Dr. Pila  left its Calle Jobos and Calle Marina location and moved to these new facilities on Avenida Las Americas (PR-163).[6]

It belongs to the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), currently the best ranked university in that country.[1]

      <p id="GL261_126_002" num_links="4">The original building of the hospital was designed by the engineer Mauricio Schwartz and was concluded by 1879. Nevertheless, in 1880 during the conflict for the Federalization of Buenos Aires, it was used as barracks for marksmen and hospital for the wounded in the battles of Puente Alsina, Corrales and Barracas.
The <link wikipedia="Buenos_Aires_Province" osm="1632167" type="relation">Province of Buenos Aires</link>, defeated by the National Army, gave control of the hospital to the School of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires and, on August 31, 1880, the National Government ratified that decision.
Built accordingly to the models of its time, the design was inspired by the <link wikipedia="Friedrichshain" osm="55763" type="relation">Friedrichshain</link> Hospital in <link wikipedia="Berlin" osm="240109189 62422" type="node relation">Berlin</link> and the lazaretto in <link wikipedia="Karlsruhe" osm="240120582 62518" type="node relation">Karlsruhe</link>.
Ever since 1927, due to the old hospital deterioration and according to needs emerging in the previous years, several projects for building a new hospital were planned but never materialized until 1949, when the current building of the Hospital de Clínicas “José de San Martín” was started in the city block formed by the streets Uriburu, Paraguay, Azcuénaga and Córdoba Avenue. The construction suffered numerous delays and only in 1962 did the first services –Radiology and Otorhinolaryngology out-patient clinic- start functioning in the new hospital. The rest of the services were gradually transferred during the following years.
It was during the first years of the 1970s decade that the new building gained full functionality and in 1975 the demolition of the old hospital was started.

The sanatorium was reported to have been an impressive facility, having nice suites, bowling alleys and pool tables. A 1904 envelope has a return address, "The Kloeber, J. S.

Hot Springs Reservation was initially created by an act of the United States Congress on April 20, 1832 to be preserved for future recreation. Established before the concept of a national park existed, it was the first time that land had been set aside by the federal government to preserve its use as an area for recreation. The hot spring water has been popularly believed for centuries to possess medicinal properties, and was a subject of legend among several Native American tribes. Following federal protection in 1832, the city developed into a successful spa town. Incorporated January 10, 1851, the city has been home to Major League Baseball spring training, illegal gambling, speakeasies and gangsters such as Al Capone, horse racing at Oaklawn Park, the Army and Navy Hospital, and 42nd President Bill Clinton. The area was made a national park on March 4, 1921.[3] Until the redesignation of Jefferson National Expansion Memorial as <link wikipedia="Gateway_Arch_National_Park" osm="628202590" type="way">Gateway Arch National Park</link> in 2018, Hot Springs was the smallest national park by area in the United States.[3] Since Hot Springs National Park is the oldest park maintained by the National Park Service, it was the first to receive its own US quarter in April 2010 as part of the America the Beautiful Quarters coin series.

      <p id="GL261_219_002" num_links="2">The present hotel is the result of the merger of the parcels of the former hôtel Beau-Rivage and of two neighbouring villas. Construction began in 1923 under the leadership of architect Théo Petit, also architect of the <link wikipedia="Hotel_Barrière_Le_Normandy_Deauville" osm="63612233" type="way">hôtel Normandy</link> at <link wikipedia="Deauville" osm="135589" type="relation">Deauville</link>. He produced an art deco design with a main façade and 2 rear wings, but only the east wing and the main body were finished when the hotel opened in 1926. The rest of the central body of the building was extended in 1928 by the architects Charles Nicod and Émile Molinié, at which date the interiors were also redecorated by Maurice Debenedetti. 2 floors were added to the top of the building in 1965 and in 1990 the façades were rebuilt uniformly in their original art deco style.

Before the official opening of the hotel, 20,000 locals visited the Chancellor on its open day. Before the late 20th century development, Launceston's hotels and structures were predominantly constructed in the nineteenth century. Robert Hosken proposed the new international hotel in the early 1980s, which he described to be "the biggest commercial development in Launceston's history." He described the facade as "classic Georgian design in the grand European style, with rustic brickwork and rendering." However, many residents thought the architecture was foreign to the rest of the city and sought a more modern and innovative design.[1]

They organized a corporation to sell shares to the local citizens. A total of 309 people bought shares, with the average investment being $500.[2] A further $150,000 was realized by selling bonds. A banquet was held on September 4, 1917 and a grand reception and ball was held two days later to celebrate the opening of the hotel. Over the years various bisinesses occupied the main floor storefronts. Bowling alleys were added in the basement in 1927.

The buildings are the most intact row of early 20th-century commercial structures in Atlanta's original business district. The decline of Hotel Row began in the 1920s due to the increased availability of automobile transportation and the construction of the Spring Street viaduct, which made getting to hotels in the northern part of the city easier. In the 1950s and 1960s, the increase in air travel led ultimately to the demolition of Terminal Station in 1971.[3][4]

Hourtin-Ville is centred around a large square with a grassy area, church and some basic facilities. Hourtin-Plage is the ocean-facing part of the town, about 12 kilometres from Hourtin-Ville, with a large sandy beach that stretches for several kilometres from north to south. This beach is easily accessible by a trail laid on top of the dune. There are also several accesses south and north but they are only accessible by bicycle via the cycle track. Ample parking is available with a few shops and facilities for tourists and visitors. Many of these facilities are seasonal. Hourtin-Port is on the Lac d'Hourtin et de Carcans, one of the great lakes of the Landes. As well as port and boating facilities, many activities are planned for the children with a play park, a mini golf course and the children's island which is a large playground for the younger ones.

The water tank was repaired using its own steel, which resulted in a reduced capacity of 30,000 imperial gallons (140,000 l).[3] In 1977 the water tower was made redundant by a mains water supply to the village, and additional living space was created. In 1979 the main water tank was removed to fully convert the building into a house. The building currently has five bedrooms and three bathrooms; it contains a total of 85 steps from top to bottom and is around 70 ft high.
