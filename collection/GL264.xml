It is located in Guntur East mandal of Guntur revenue division. It is  12 km away from Guntur. Due to its proximity to the town the village boasts of many educated people. Jonnalagadda  is a politically active village and the first Assembly Speaker of Andhra Pradesh, Mr Nallapati Venkata Ramaiah comes from this village. Jonnalagadda is a perfect village with soils suitable to grow  rice and rainfed crops, and dairy, temples, Kalyana Mandapam (contributed by TTD), schools and Pharma and engineering colleges. There are 7 temples in the village i.e. Sai baba temple, Vinayaka temple, Venugopala swamy temple, Anjeneya swamy temple, Sivalayam, Poleramma temple and Gangamma temple besides Boddurai where prayers are offered on special occasions. As per the inscription available at the premises, the Venugopala swamy temple was constructed by a chieftain of Kakatiya Rudramadevi, in reciprocation to the comfortable treatment for his army during one of his endeavours by the then village chief Sri Jonnalagadda Verri Ragaiah.  It has been renovated since then. Sai baba temple, though recent, has gained importance among the residents of Jonnalagada as well as Narasaroapet. It has become a custom to celebrate Sai baba Thirunala (fair) every year on May 18. It is a huge festival in Jonnalagada. Many people from different places, from near and far,  participate in the proceedings on that day. Four famous engineering colleges are there near the village. Every sankranthi festival is celebrated by conducting sports, games and yedla pandalu (bull racing), in which many people from nearby villages also take part and enjoy. Every festival is celebrated with pomp and show.  One of the major festivals is Vinayaka chavithi. Children enjoy identifying and collecting herbs for puja, preparing Ganesh idols with clay, performing puja and immersing the God in Kuppagunji vagu. Occasionally, Poleramma and Gangamma jataras are performed. 
Jonnalagadda stands as an example for communal amity with a church (since 1952) and a mosque. Chritmas and Ramjan are celebrated with equal fervor. Jonnalagadda has a satellite village, Rangareddy Palem.
Jonnalagadda village also stands as a mute witness to the exploitation of colonial British, with 3 pairs of abandoned Neelimandu bavulu (wells) used for processing blue, cultivation of which must have rendered many fertile lands useless. These wells still can be seen behind Poleramma temple.

Jon's Cave is high above the sea. North of the cave, there is an almost vertical rockface known as Hvidkleven (White Cliff). The caves to the south are known as Jons Sovekammer (Jon's Bedroom), Jons Sakristi, Jons Spisestue (Jon's Dining Room) and Jons Madkælder (Jon's Food Cellar).[6] The bluff has been identified into three climbing grades depending on the difficulty level, at 10 metres (33 ft) intervals. Kangaroo Point, at 10 metres (33 ft) from the base level, is Grade 3, and is one of the better and secure routes. The second level, called Alle Veje fører til Hasle ("All roads lead to Hasle"), is also Grade 3 .The third, known as the Udsigten ("the prospect"), is Grade 4.[6]

It is named after Sgt. Joshua Eaton, the only Reading casualty in the American Revolutionary War. The school is located at the corner of Summer Avenue and Oak Street, close to the site of Joshua Eaton's family home. In 1944, Dr. William K. Wilson, supervisor of educational planning of school buildings for the New York State Education Department, was hired to study the Reading school system. One of his observations was that an elementary school was needed in the area of Prescott Street, Main Street and the railroad tracks. His recommendation was that the school should plan to accommodate 500 children from kindergarten through grade six. When Joshua Eaton opened in 1949, it housed grades 1-6. Today, it houses around 450 children in kindergarten through fifth grade. The building was designed by reading architect George Sidebottom. The original building consisted of 18 classrooms, an auditorium, cafeteria and gymnasium. At that time, the school was chosen as the best-designed elementary school building in the nation (38,000 blueprints were submitted).  Joshua Eaton was dedicated on Sunday, October 23, 1949.

The white, wooden church, which has 120 seats, was built around 1660 by builder Hans Ottesen Ravn.  The present church is the third church to be located here.  The first church was a stave church that was probably built in the 13th century.  It stood for over 300 years before it was replaced by a new stave church in 1553.  That stave church was torn down in 1660 when the present church was completed.[1][2][3]

He had been a royalist until 1822, but switched sides and joined Lanza's insurrectionist army at the age of 18. His advance in the Bolivian army was unremarkable, although his role was apparently fundamental to the Confederate triumph over Salaverry at the Battle of Socabaya (early 1836). Importantly, he had been a supporter of Santa Cruz in the 1830s. His golden hour came, and he rose dramatically to the occasion, when at aged 37 and as Bolivian Army chief he united the pro-Velasco and pro-Santa Cruz factions under his command to face-off a massive Peruvian invasion led by President Agustín Gamarra. At the <link wikipedia="Battle_of_Ingavi" osm="2145192906" type="node">Battle of Ingavi</link> (November 1841), Ballivián emerged with a surprising and crushing victory against Gamarra, whom he took prisoner and ordered executed. It was a stunning turn of events, and one that marks the highest point in Bolivian military history. Ingavi preserved Bolivian independence and transformed Ballivián into an overnight hero in a fractured nation badly in need of one. Congress almost immediately proclaimed him Provisional President in Calvo's replacement. Marshall Santa Cruz, from France, acquiesced to his rule and declined to return in the face of the enormous popularity of the new Caudillo.

This made him a wanted man among the owners of haciendas and with the government in Montevideo. A reward was put out for his death.[5]

Encouraged by his mother, Mariana, Perales sang  at some local festivals in his hometown.
However, it was not until he met Rafael Trabucchelli (an influential Italian music producer in Spain at the time) in 1970 that his musical career took a dramatic turn. Trabucchelli discovered the young composer and talented, but reluctant, singer. Perales composed "Porque te vas" (Because you are leaving), which was performed by Jeanette and sold 4 million copies worldwide in 1976. After much encouragement from Trabucchelli and his supporters, Perales decided to give singing a try.  His first record, "Celos de mi Guitarra" (Jealous of my Guitar) was a huge success in Spain and in Latin America.

The fourth competition held in 1943 resulted in the selection of a design by the architect Aquiles Maza and the sculptor Juan José Sicre.

Various impediments to the acquisition of the Hermitage by the state led to delays in the demolition and the start of building work, so by 1952 – when Fulgencio Batista seized power in a coup – work on the construction had still not begun.

The ancient Maya site of Joya de Cerén is located in the Zapotitán Valley 36 kilometers northwest of <link wikipedia="San_Salvador" osm="197701710 6462027" type="node relation">San Salvador</link>, El Salvador.[1] It is often referred to as the "<link wikipedia="Pompeii" osm="4753980853" type="node">Pompeii</link> of the Americas", in comparison to the famed Ancient Roman ruins. This site is known for the excellent preservation of a Classic period settlement that was rapidly buried by the ashfall of an eruption of the Loma Caldera around A.D. 600.[2] The relative abundance of paleoethnobotanical remains recovered at Joya de Cerén in comparison to other ancient Maya archaeological sites make Joya de Cerén particularly significant in the study of everyday life of ancient Maya agricultural communities. Of importance was the discovery of a manioc field, the first instance of manioc cultivation identified at a New World archaeological site.[3] The site was thought to have been settled between A.D. 200 and A.D. 600.[4] Joya de Cerén was entered on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1993 and is a major tourist attraction in El Salvador.[5]

</p>
      <p id="GL264_383_002" num_links="2">1,400 years before the village was abandoned, the population was estimated to be 200 people.[6] The eruption of the <link wikipedia="San_Salvador_(volcano)" osm="2601741115" type="node">Loma Caldera volcano</link> caused 10 meters of pyroclastic debris to settle over the site.[7][8] The site was remarkably well preserved due to the low temperature of ash and very fast ashfall, a 4 - 8 meter thick layer having blanketed the town in the space of a few hours. The use of plaster casting by archaeologists similar to the one used in <link wikipedia="Pompeii" osm="4753980853" type="node">Pompeii</link> assisted in their identification of fruiting plants, abundance of beans in storage, and mature maize to predict the eruption happened in August or September.[9] Guava, agave, cacao, and manioc were some of the major crops to the community.[10] Based on crack patterns observed from the relatively earthquake-resistant wattle-and-daub walls and adobe columns at Joya de Cerén, scholars suggest that an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale preceded the eruption, giving residents time to flee the site.[11] Further, possible steamy emissions from the volcano may have alerted residents of the impending danger, but only inferences can be made about what exactly warned them.[12] It is unclear to scholars if the duration of the eruptions lasted a few days or a few weeks.[13] 
The position of artifacts at the site have led scholars to suggest that the evacuation of Joya de Cerén happened in the early evening: shovels and other agricultural work equipment were found stored near the domestic structures, and fires had been lit in hearths. [14] Also, sleeping mats had not yet been rolled out on the domicile floor. [15] No human remains have been discovered at the ancient Maya site.[16]
