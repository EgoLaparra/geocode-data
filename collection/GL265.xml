</p>
      <p id="GL265_009_002" num_links="2">The memorial began with an initiative of Simon Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal became a spokesman for the public offense taken over the Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus in Albertinaplatz, created by <link wikipedia="Alfred_Hrdlicka" osm="582075382" type="node">Alfred Hrdlicka</link> in 1988, which portrayed Jewish victims in an undignified way. As a result of this controversy, Wiesenthal began the commission for a memorial dedicated especially to the Jewish victims of Nazi fascism in Austria. It was built by the city of Vienna under the Mayor Michael Häupl, after Rachel Whiteread's design was chosen unanimously by an international jury under the leadership of the architect Hans Hollein. The members of the jury were Michael Haupl, Ursula Pasterk, Hannes Swoboda, Amnon Barzel, Phyllis Lambert, Sylvie Liska, Harald Szeemann, George Weidenfeld, Simon Wiesenthal, and Robert Storr. Individuals and teams of artists and architects from Austria, Israel, Great Britain and the United States were invited to the competition. They were Valie Export; <link wikipedia="Karl_Prantl_(sculptor)" osm="1806604113" type="node">Karl Prantl</link> and Peter Waldbauer as a team; Zbynek Sekal; Heimo Zobernig, working with Michael Hofstatter and Wolfgang Pauzenberger; Michael Clegg and Martin Guttman as a team; Ilya Kabakov; Rachel Whiteread; and Peter Eisenman.[1] The submissions had to take into account the design constraints of the site at Judenplatz, and texts including a memorial inscription and the listing of all concentration camps in which Austrian Jews were killed.[2][3]

Kearns married Judge's niece, Jennie Judge. Judge Mercy Home, more commonly called Judge Miner's Home, was designed by architect David C. Dart. The hospital was established for the population of Catholic coal miners working in Park City who suffered from black lung. As the need for a hospital dedicated to this cause subsided in direct relation to the decline of coal mining east of Salt Lake, Mary Judge (who along with her deceased husband, John, was the benefactor of the hospital) expressed her wishes to the bishop of the Diocese of Salt Lake to reopen the medical facility as a school. Mary Judge died before the diocese opened the new school's doors. The cornerstone was laid by Bishop Scanlan in the fall of 1902 but the hospital was not opened until the fall of 1910. The hospital was originally intended to provide medical treatment for aged and infirm miners. Many miners working in <link wikipedia="Park_City,_Utah" osm="198864" type="relation">Park City</link> suffered from silicosis, also known as "miners' consumption", the disease that killed Mary's husband John at the age of 48.[2] With <link wikipedia="Salt_Lake_Regional_Medical_Center" osm="459884061" type="way">Holy Cross Hospital</link> a few blocks away, the need for a miners' hospital was not great; it was remodeled and opened as a school in the fall of 1920, under the name "Cathedral School."

He took part in the uprising against Napoleon III during the French coup of 1851, fighting together with his friend Arthur Ranc at one of the rare barricades on December 2.

The brothers staked a claim and mined for a year, before building a cabin in 1863 on the Cottonwood Creek near the site of the present Julia Davis Park. On July 4, 1863, Fort Boise was established and shortly after, the Davis brothers along with seven friends met in the Davis' cabin and planned the formation of the City of Boise. According to one of the friends, William Lowery Ritchie, “in the summer of 1863 the soldiers came and established the garrison; that was sometime early in July. It was about that time we met in our cabin and formed a town co.” [2] Thomas Davis came to play a pivotal role in the development of Boise as a city and sought to help attract visitors and pioneers to the valley. With his mining claim being less than profitable, Davis turned to the promotion of agriculture by planting 7,000 apple trees on his land along the Boise River. Additionally, he started buying up land in the valley from the United States land office, receiving Cash Certificate No. 1 for 160 acres (0.65 km2) in 1868 when the first land office opened up.[3] Within several years, Davis went on to purchase the first water rights in the valley, as well as an additional 1,150 acres (4.7 km2) from the federal government along the foothills and where the town of <link wikipedia="Garden_City,_Idaho" osm="121362" type="relation">Garden City</link> was developed.

      <p id="GL265_102_002" num_links="2">Known as the "angel of the prisons," Tutwiler pushed for many reforms of the Alabama penal system. In a letter sent from Julia Tutwiler in <link wikipedia="Dothan,_Alabama" osm="153693068 110367" type="node relation">Dothan, Alabama</link> to Frank S. White in <link wikipedia="Birmingham,_Alabama" osm="153466590 111031" type="node relation">Birmingham, Alabama</link>, Tutwiler pushed for key issues such as the end to convict leasing, the re-establishment of night school education, and the separation of minor offenders and hardened criminals.[3] Tutwiler's letter cites major controversies during her time such as the Banner Mining Incident of 1911, where 125 of the 128 dead miners were convicts, predominately guilty of minor offenses, leased by state prisons.[4] She additionally suggested medical and psychological treatment for convicts such as rehabilitation for drug addicts, sanitation, and nurses to care for dying inmates who lack families willing to visit them. 
Despite her progressive stance on prison reform, Tutwiler also pandered to a segregationist approach to the prison system, advocating the separation of prison inmates by race as it is "important for public welfare to separate them in all other relations- in schools, in travel, and in social life, it would be better for both races if this could be done here also." She also critiques the education of white inmates in her push for the re-establishment of night school, commenting on how at the state farm in Speigner "there are more white men than negroes who cannot read."[3]

Philibert became the first abbot, and Balthild's generosity added "many gifts and pastures from the royal fisc"[2] but he was later obliged to leave Jumièges through the jealousy of certain enemies, and spent a period of exile from Neustria at the court of Bishop Ansoald of Poitiers;[3] afterwards he founded monasteries at <link wikipedia="Pavilly" osm="113377" type="relation">Pavilly</link>, <link wikipedia="Montivilliers" osm="26692276 109657" type="node relation">Montivilliers</link> and <link wikipedia="Noirmoutier" osm="3066510" type="relation">Noirmoutier</link>,[4] where he died in about 685.

The main location has been described as a theme park of food. Founded in 1971 by "Jungle" Jim Bonaminio, the store started as a small produce stand, and has grown to over 180,000 items, about 60,000 of which are international items, and over 300,000 square feet (6½ acres or 26,000 square meters) of floorspace.[1] Jungle Jim's is notable for one of the largest wine collections in the <link wikipedia="United_States" osm="424317935 148838" type="node relation">United States</link>,[2] live seafood tanks, and an in-store cooking school. Each week, the store is visited by approximately 82,000 shoppers,[3] whom Bonaminio calls "foodies". Many of the specialty foods in the store's Asian and European departments are difficult to find elsewhere in the Greater Cincinnati area, and customers have been known to drive from other cities for the store's wide variety of food.

</p>
      <p id="GL265_269_002" num_links="2">Jungle Jim's resembles a theme park due to the unusual displays throughout the store. At the entrance, animal replicas are accompanied by occasional roars and the splashing of a miniature waterfall in the background. Inside are several animatronic displays, such as a lion that sings Elvis Presley songs at regular intervals and a "rock band" composed of General Mills cereal mascots. Several of the animatronics, such as the lion, a human character named Pedro, and a trio of black birds, are former <link wikipedia="Chuck_E._Cheese's" osm="5830983117 702198672" type="node way">Pizza Time Theatre</link> animatronics (indeed, the lion character was known as "The King" at PTT, and served the same purpose of singing Elvis songs). The miniature storefronts in Jungle Jim's' European section represent the architectural styles of various countries, and the Mexican section is covered by what appears to be the adobe façade and wooden frame of a cantina. Subtle humor is injected into many parts of the store, such as the trashcans once labeled "Jungle Junk," the "Adult Oriented Hot Sauces" section, and the restroom entrances disguised as <link wikipedia="Rumpke_Sanitary_Landfill" osm="60013599" type="way">Rumpke</link> portable toilets. In 2007, the restrooms won the Cintas Best Restroom in America contest. Before Jungle Jim's doubled in size in the late 1990s, the store featured flags from many countries that were positioned throughout the store and automatically waved back and forth, to give it an "international" feel.

It was platted, organized, and became the county seat in late 1871, the first school district in the county was established there, and the first newspaper in the county, the Adams County Gazette, was published there. During the 1870s the Commercial Hotel, south of the railroad depot, was one of the largest in Nebraska west of Lincoln. It was demolished in 1879. On April 12, 1872, the county commissioners declined a request from the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad for $75,000 in bonds to build 25 miles of track, reasoning that the line would be built anyway and would logically cross the Burlington line at Juniata. Instead the railroad laid its tracks seven miles east and set up the new town of <link wikipedia="Hastings,_Nebraska" osm="151335437 169648" type="node relation">Hastings</link>,[7] which in September 1878 won a five-year Great County Seat War and became the county seat.[8] Juniata continued to grow and now has more residents than in the 1880s. However, it has suffered a number of disastrous fires, the last in 1961, and in 1960 a tornado destroyed the 2-story town pump with bandstand that had been built in 1904 at the intersection of Juniata Avenue and Tenth Street. Because of its proximity to Hastings, Juniata is today a commuter suburb.[7]

With good natural attractions - <link wikipedia="Mount_Namuli" osm="335172051" type="node">Namuli mountain range</link> (2419 m), large tea plantations (chá in Portuguese), and rivers, leading tea brands, such as Cha St Antonio, Cha Murrace, Chá Moçambique, Chá Licungo, Chá Gurúè, and Chá Montebranco Junqueiro, achieved international recognition – most of the production was exported to the <link wikipedia="United_Kingdom" osm="838090640 62149" type="node relation">United Kingdom</link>, United States and <link wikipedia="Canada" osm="424313760 1428125" type="node relation">Canada</link>. Other agricultural activities were developed as well. In the 1940s, over 300 Portuguese lived in the small town of Gurúè which gravitated around the tea aristocracy who provided all the amenities for the entire working population, including a private small airline to the largest cities on the coast, like <link wikipedia="Nampula" osm="286426799" type="node">Nampula</link>, and the port city of <link wikipedia="Quelimane" osm="259593870" type="node">Quelimane</link>, the capital of <link wikipedia="Zambezia_Province" osm="2997943" type="relation">Zambezia</link>, in Portuguese East Africa. After the death of tea tycoon Manuel Saraiva Junqueiro, in an airplane crash, the town of Gurúè was renamed Vila Junqueiro in October 1959. By the late 1950s the town had grown, the cinema was founded and TAZ airline (Transportes Aéreos da Zambézia) increased its flights in the town’s airfield. Under Portuguese administration the town expanded harmoniously in terms of urbanism and architectural landscape.[1][2]

      <p id="GL265_316_002" num_links="2">Juodkrantė was first mentioned (as Schwarzort) by the Teutonic Knights in 1429 in a letter describing storm damages.

In the early 17th century, due to the Black Death, and moving sand dunes threatening to bury the village, it lost almost all of its inhabitants. In the 1680s, the village relocated to its present location along the <link wikipedia="Curonian_Lagoon" osm="325606935 7546467" type="node relation">Curonian Lagoon</link> shore. After 1724, the sources do not mention the village along the Baltic Sea shore any more. The village did quite well in the new location: a tavern was opened in 1673, a school in 1743, and a wooden church in 1795. Until 1740 the village belonged to German: Kreis Memel (Klaipėda County), then from 1740-1795 to Church District German: Kirchspiel Karwaiten (Karvaičiai). It grew in importance after Carwaiten/Karvaičiai/Karwaiten village was swallowed by traveling sand and the seat of the Church District relocated here. The wooden church burned down in 1878 but was soon replaced by a red brick Lutheran church in 1885.

Corrientes supported Urquiza's action, but Rosas and the other provinces[citation needed] condemned the "crazy, traitor, savage, unitarian" Urquiza.

Jutogh cantonment was established in the year 1843 Cantonment Board, Jutogh is a statutory body constituted under the Cantonments Act, 2006. The emergence of the Cantonment Board as a municipal body in cantonments was basically in response to the need for maintenance of proper sanitation, health and hygiene in these areas. The scope of the Cantonment Board functions extends to the entire gamut of municipal administration. In addition to providing basic amenities, Cantonment Board, Jutogh also manages public welfare institutions and facilities to the residents of the cantonment area.  Jutogh was acquired by the British Government in 1843. It was first occupied by a regiment of Gurkhas, and was afterwards made over to the Governors of the Bishop Cotton School, but, being found unsuitable for this purpose, was for a time abandoned. Two batteries of British Mountain Artillery and two companies of British Infantry are stationed here during the summer months.
