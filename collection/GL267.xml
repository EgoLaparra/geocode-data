According to the ancient reports, the <link wikipedia="Argos" osm="286519134 5348847" type="node relation">Argive</link> colonists had sustained severe losses in a war with the native Carians, so they invited the son of Neleus, who had previously founded <link wikipedia="Miletus" osm="32255827" type="way">Miletus</link>, to come to their assistance. The town appears on that occasion to have received additional settlers.[2] The town, which appears to have occupied the whole of the little island, had only ten stadia in circumference; but it nevertheless acquired great wealth,[3] from its fisheries and trade in fish.[4] Iasos was a member of the Delian League and was involved in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC). After the Sicilian expedition of the <link wikipedia="Classical_Athens" osm="5688115" type="relation">Athenians</link>, Iasos was attacked by the <link wikipedia="Sparta" osm="5348685" type="relation">Spartans</link> and their allies; it was governed at the time by Amorges, a Persian chief, who had revolted from Darius II. It was taken by the Spartans, who captured Amorges and delivered him up to Tissaphernes. The town itself was plundered on that occasion. It became part of the Hecatomnid satrapy in the 4th century and was conquered by Alexander. We afterwards find it besieged by Philip V, king of Macedon, who, however, was compelled by the Romans to restore it to Ptolemy V of Egypt.[5] The mountains in the neighbourhood of Iasus furnished a beautiful kind of marble, of a blood-red and livid white colour, which was used by the ancients for ornamental purposes.[6] Near the town was a sanctuary of Hestia, with a statue of the goddess, which, though standing in the open air, was believed never to be touched by the rain.[7] The same story is related, by Strabo, of a temple of Artemis in the same neighbourhood. Iasus, as a celebrated fishing place, is alluded to by Athenaeus.[8] The place is still existing, under the name of Askem or Asýn Kalessi. Chandler (Travels in As. Min. p. 226) relates that the island on which the town was built is now united to the mainland by a small isthmus. Part of the city walls still exist, and are of a regular, solid, and handsome structure. In the side of the rock a theatre with many rows of seats still remains, and several inscriptions and coins have been found there.

The Iberg is an old coral reef that emerged in the Givetian/Frasnian (Devonian) stages, that was created as an atoll in the middle of the ocean, probably from the base of a volcano. The reef was mainly built by corals und stromatoporoidea. Later, as the Frasnian transitioned into the Famennian, these reef-building organisms died out leaving the reef unfinished. During the Famennian and Mississippian crevices emerged that were filled with crinoid, brachiopod und goniatite chalks.

He had two brothers, Hysni and Ali, both bearing titles hafiz and hadji. Ibrahim was an early childhood friend of Seremedin and Murat Toptani, with whom he kept close ties for the rest of hist life.[3] He studied theology in <link wikipedia="Istanbul" osm="223474" type="relation">Istanbul</link>. There he came in contact with the activists of the Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights. He returned to Tirana where he started working as a teacher in 1901. At the same time he was a member of the local branch of the Bashkimi (Unity) Club, one of the many of that time throughout all Albanian populated areas. He participated in the Congress of Elbasan, during 2–9 September 1909, as part of the Tirana delegation.[3] One of the Congress's main achievement was the establishment of the <link wikipedia="University_of_Elbasan" osm="295658286" type="way">Normal School of Elbasan</link> which would prepare teachers for supporting the spread of Albanian education. He was imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities during 1909-1911 due to his nationalist activity.[1] On 26 November 1912, Dalliu was an active participant in the ceremony of raising the Albanian flag in Tirana, 2 days before the National Declaration of Independence. At the same time he drafted a letter-protest which was sent to the Serbian army approaching from the north.[3]
From April 25 to May 3, 1921, he took part in the Congress for National Unity in <link wikipedia="Vlorë" osm="33208756 1255534 1255543" type="node relation relation">Vlora</link>, together with Musa Maçi as representatives of the society "Lidhja Kombëtare" (National League), Qazim Mulleti of Tirana's society "Vllaznia-Zgjimi" (Brotherhood - Awakening), and <link wikipedia="Avni_Rustemi" osm="318665845" type="way">Avni Rustemi</link> for the society "Bashkimi" (Union). During the interbellum period, Dalliu focused on teaching, writing, and translation. He is remembered in Albanian as one of the few high rank clerics who were devoted to the national cause as well as to religion. He taught for many years at the Madrasa of Tirana and wrote many work and studies on Islam. He also wrote satirical poetry,[4] and published the newspaper Dajti (<link wikipedia="Dajti" osm="26863587" type="node">Dajt</link>).[5]
He was part of the <link wikipedia="Parliament_of_Albania" osm="256162012" type="way">National Assembly</link> in 1943.[6] With the rise of the communists in power in 1944, he was arrested and imprisoned due to his engagement in politics and some sharp anti-communist poetry he had written.[1] Dalliu died in jail on 25 May 1952, and was annihilated by the communist historiography.

The current flows north from the <link wikipedia="Southern_Ocean" osm="305639157" type="node">Southern Ocean</link> and offshore winds drive the surface water away from the coast. Water rises from depths of hundreds of metres and at speeds of up to 12 m per minute bringing nutrients to the surface. A combination of sunlight and nutrients provide the conditions for phytoplankton which are the foundation for other life in the Benguela marine ecosystem. Feeding on the phytoplankton are Zooplankton, which attract an abundance of shoaling pelagic fish and is the reason why southern Africa is home to one of the richest seabird communities in the world. The islands off the west coast of southern Africa provide refuge from predators and Cape gannet (Morus capensis) and Cape cormorants (Phalacrocorax capensis) are the region's most abundant seabirds with tens of thousands on the islands during the nesting season. The birds guano also provide nutrients which flow into the surrounding sea when large waves hit the island or when it rains. The guano enriches the rocky shore with carpets of seaweed grazed by goat's-eye limpets, which are predated by spiny starfish.[2]

"I was not shy," she wrote in her autobiography, "but wild as a boy, and bolder and more forward than my elder brothers."[3] Her first long journey was a trip to Palestine and Egypt when she was five years old. The influence of this experience remained with her.

The various Stadtteile have, however, retained their original identities, which, aside from the somewhat more urban character encountered in Idar and Oberstein, tend to hearken back to each centre's history as a rural village.
