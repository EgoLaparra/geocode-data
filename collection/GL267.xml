It also seems likely that Pinedjem I intended to usurp this tomb for his own burial, but that he too abandoned the plan. KV4 is notable for being the last royal tomb that was quarried in the Valley and because it has been interpreted as being a workshop used during the official dismantling of the royal necropolis in the early Third Intermediate Period.

It was discovered by Edward R. Ayrton in 1907 while he was working in the Valley for Theodore M. Davis.

The results of genetic and other scientific tests published in February 2010 have confirmed that the person buried there was both the son of Amenhotep III as well as the father of Tutankhamun. Furthermore, the study established that the age of this person at the time of his death was consistent with that of Akhenaten's, thereby making it almost certain that it is Akhenaten's body.[1] However, a growing body of work soon began to appear to dispute the assessment of the age of the mummy and the identification of KV55 as Akhenaten.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]

The church at first supported the Tutsi ruling elite, but later backed the Hutu majority.
During the 1994 Rwandan Genocide thousands of Tutsis who had taken refuge here were killed. Some survivors admire the courage of many priests who helped them during those difficult days,like Father Evergiste RUKEBESHA and many others. Later, some Hutus including three bishops and many priests were killed by the rebels RPF soldiers. A mass grave beside the hospital is marked by a memorial. Inside the Basilica are kept the bodies of the three beshops killed by FPR rebels. Two of them (Vincent Nsengiyumva, the Archbishop of Kigali and Joseph Ruzindana, Bishop of Byumba) were refused by the Rwandan government to be transferred in their own cathedrals.

In 1670, Przetocki sold the manor of Kaczkowo to Bishop Stanisław Dąmbski (ca. 1638-1700).  Dąmbski built a summer palace there.  At his death, the manor included the villages of Kaczkowo, Glinno, Skalmirowice, Mierogonowice, <link wikipedia="Topola" osm="419136775" type="node">Topola</link>, Płonkowo, Dobiesławice, and Zapola.

Antoni sold the manor to his brother-in-law (and third cousin) Kazimierz Dąmbski, in 1741.[2]  Kazimierz's son, Jan Chrziciel Dąmbski, Count of Lubraniec, inherited the manor in 1765.  He was living at Kaczkowo in 1812, when foreign troops from Wuerttemberg destroyed the palace.[3] In 1831, Jan Chrziciel's elder son, Apolinary Dąmbski, inherited Kaczkowo, while his younger son, Kazimierz (whose right to the title "Count Dombski" was recognized by the Prussian government in 1821) inherited Płonkowo.  He died in 1833, leaving two daughters and a son, Stanislaw Kostka, who had no issue.[4]

The girth of the trunk is about 10 metres (33 ft). In 1818 the tree was badly damaged by a huge fire in the village, which caused the trunk to split in two. It developed an abnormal growth to compensate for the damage done by the fire. This lime tree has often been written about and depicted, especially in Germany, and has also been used as a case study in dendrology, the science of trees and wooded plants. With its large girth it was ranked among the biggest lime trees in Germany even in the 19th century. The Kaditz Lime is also said to have served as a kind of <link wikipedia="Pillory" osm="2597468800" type="node">pillory</link> in the Middle Ages.

A port settlement dating from the Phoenicians has also been discovered.

It was founded c. 1560 AD when three families of the Maalouf clan, living at the time across the valley in the village of Mhaydse, received permission from the ruling emir to establish the village. The Maalouf family history is traced back to the very beginnings of Christianity in the <link wikipedia="Middle_East" osm="414980155 415145069" type="node node">Middle East</link> beginning with the Ghassanid tribe, which converted to Christianity nearly 2,000 years ago.

The preservation effort has the intent of documenting every known person bearing the Maalouf name. All Maalouf families originate from Kafarakab.[citation needed]
