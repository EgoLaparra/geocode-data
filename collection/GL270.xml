The Imphy steelworks was detached from the company and combined with the Saint-Seurin steelworks.

In 1869 the two steelworks were reunited with the company.[4]
In 1954 the company was renamed the Société métallurgique d'Imphy.
In 1968 it was merged with the Société des forges et aciéries du Creusot, which in 1971 became Creusot-Loire.[3]
The combined company was in turn absorbed by Creusot-Loire (Saône-et-Loire) in 1971.
The Creusot-Loire group was liquidated in December 1984.[4]

It opened during the 1977-1978 school year under principal Fed McClure.  The initial enrollment was 420 students consisting of freshman and sophomore students only.

The area's mining history dates to at least 1897, when active claims were reported in the vicinity of Fishook Creek.  These early mining efforts were eventually joined to form the Wasilla Mining Company, which worked the mines from 1934 to 1943, and again from 1948 to 1950.  The mining operation at Independence was the second-largest hard-rock gold mining operation in the state, after a larger site near <link wikipedia="Juneau,_Alaska" osm="150918835 2605281" type="node relation">Juneau</link>.  The company and the miners that preceded it built a substantial mining camp, with as many as sixteen wood frame buildings, which were originally connected to each other by sheltered wooden "tunnels".  When the company ended operations in 1950, it had expected to eventually resume operations, but never did; this resulted in a particularly well-preserved collection of mining equipment and buildings, although the weather has since taken a significant toll on the latter.[2]

As the uniting of Lutheran and Reformed Christians in Germany proceeded, some Lutheran groups dissented and formed independent churches, especially in Prussia, Saxony, Hanover and Hesse.  These Lutherans held that Reformed doctrine and Lutheran doctrine are contradictory on many points (especially on the nature of the Real Presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper), and that such doctrinal differences precluded altar fellowship. So in the 1820s and 1830s Lutherans in Prussia and their congregations formed a new Lutheran church, recognised by the king in 1845 as the Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Preußen (Evangelical Lutheran Church in Prussia).

In 2005, the course was cited by Golf Digest in their rating of Auburn as the "best golf city in America".[1] It is a par 71 course with summer bermuda grass and a bentgrass/ryegrass mix in the winter. Indian Pines was originally constructed in 1946 as the Saugahatchee County Club, a nine-hole course, with the first tournament being held on July 4, 1947.  The back nine holes, designed by Eddie Loos, were built in 1951.[2] In 1976, the course was sold to the cities of Auburn and Opelika, which have operated it as a municipal course since. The course was redesigned in 1999. After fire destroyed the old clubhouse, a new clubhouse was constructed in 2006.[3]  Indian Pines hosts the Indian Pines Invitational, an amateur tournament drawing 200 participants and sponsored by Miller Lite.[4]  Indian Pines is the home course of the Auburn High School Tigers golf team.

The park is located on 3 acres (1.2 ha) in a natural depression north of East River Drive and to the west of a railroad trestle bridge.[3] The land was donated to the city in 1921 by Mrs. D.N. Richardson with the expressed purpose of creating a park.[4]  The property contains a spring that was used by Native Americans, from which the park derives its name, as well as early travelers and the areas first settlers.  The spring itself was capped in 1929 and a pipe 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter directs the water into a storm drain.[4]  During the high water season in the spring the park's basin fills with spring water and shore birds return to nest.  The park, which is largely undeveloped,[5] has served as a play area for the neighborhood children, students from neighboring Hoover Elementary School, and later the day care that is housed there.  The park is a contributing property in the Village of East Davenport Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  It was added to the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 2005.

A new high school, Shadow Hills in the northern half of Indio will decrease the number of students in the 2009/10 school year.[5] In the 2009/10 school year Desert Sands was deciding whether to close the school at the end of the 2009/10 school year, due to low Standardized Test scores. That year the scores went up dramatically and the board instead voted to renovate the school, which was approved. The School was featured in a video for success 101, a course for freshmen entering high school to help them transition from middle to high school. Freshman students, faculty, and teachers of the 2010/11 school year were followed all school year to see how the class had helped them.[6] For the 2011/12 school year the school moved from a six-period day schedule to an eight-period A/B Block schedule. This was done to give the students more electives and also so they would have opportunities to get more credits. On May 1, 2013 at 8:52, there was a fire at the boy's locker room coaches office. Firefighters took out the fire in about a half an hour.[7]
