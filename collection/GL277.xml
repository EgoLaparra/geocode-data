      <p id="GL277_015_002" num_links="2">First settled in 1621, the town developed as a trading and, later, shipbuilding and shipping center with light manufacturing. It was part of the town of <link wikipedia="Wells,_Maine" osm="158808778 2021560" type="node relation">Wells</link> and <link wikipedia="Kennebunkport,_Maine" osm="158871214 2021557" type="node relation">Arundel</link> until 1820, when it incorporated as a separate town. "Kennebunk, the only village in the world so named," was featured on a large locally famous sign attached to the Kesslen Shoe Mill on Route One. To the Abenaki Indians, Kennebunk meant "the long cut bank," presumably the long bank behind Kennebunk Beach. Kennebunk's coastline is divided into three major sections. Mother's Beach, Middle Beach or Rocky Beach, and Gooch's Beach or Long Beach. Separate from Kennebunk Beach is secluded Parson's Beach, a quiet alternative to the summer crowds. Note there is some local controversy regarding the "Mother's Beach" moniker, (nickname). According to many local residents, the smaller of the three main beaches - at the intersection of Beach Ave and Ridge Ave - is officially Kennebunk Beach or, alternatively, Boothby Beach. The term Boothby beach was from the mid-1730s when a Mabel Littlefield married Richard Boothby and settled on land near what came to be known as Boothby Beach.The information about the Boothbys was taken from "Old News From Southern Maine" article on Mable and Richard Boothby, by Sharon Cummins. Many natives today may not remember it being called Boothby Beach and over the years the beach came to be known as Kennebunk Beach or Mothers Beach. Older residents also recall the name Dipsy Bath Beach, a reference to the baths once located there.  The term Mother's Beach didn't come into widespread use until the mid '80s; Although other native residents will dispute that date and say they remember it being called "Mothers Beach" as far back as the late 1950s. The name likely evolved due to its small size and generally calmer water, due to the rocks under and above the ocean, thus making it a natural made harbor of refuge that is safer for swimming and which makes it popular with mothers keeping a watchful eye on their progeny, (children).  The name is clearly descriptive rather than official, in spite of the recent installation of road signs pointing the way to "Mother's Beach".[5] Contradicting the above beach naming is the Town's website listing "Permits are valid for Gooch’s Beach, Kennebunk Beach (Middle Beach) and Mother’s Beach."[6] Additionally without public parking access both Libbys and Crescent beaches are in Kennebunk between Parson's beach and Mother's beach.

During the Civil War, Kennesaw was the staging ground for the Great Locomotive Chase on April 12, 1862.

      <p id="GL277_050_001" num_links="2">The Kennesaw House was built in 1845, making it one of Marietta's oldest buildings. Intended to be a cotton warehouse, the building was turned into the Fletcher House <link wikipedia="Hotel" osm="2691266967 619083332" type="node way">hotel</link> in 1855 after it was purchased by Dix Fletcher.  The Fletcher as it was called was where the Great Locomotive Chase began.  While some may claim it started in Big Shanty (now <link wikipedia="Kennesaw,_Georgia" osm="153852508 119639" type="node relation">Kennesaw</link>), it began at the Fletcher House.  James Andrews, a civilian working with the Union Army, made his way down to Marietta along with disguised Union soldiers in April 1862.  On the night of April 11, Andrews and some of the men spent the night at the Fletcher House.  A historic reproduction of what the room may have looked like has been re-created at the Marietta Museum of History, in the room that the men supposedly slept.  The men, along with their leader James Andrews boarded the train on April 12 with the rest of the passengers.  The Kennesaw House was one of the only buildings in Marietta not burned to the ground during William Tecumseh Sherman's Atlanta Campaign, partly because Fletcher was a Mason, and his son-in-law was a Union spy. The building, like many others on the Marietta square was converted to a war hospital for the confederate army. Many wounded soldiers were transported to Marietta after the battle of Antietam which was the bloodiest battle in Georgia.

It was a royal manor in the parish of St Mary, Lambeth in the county of Surrey and was the administrative centre of the parish from 1853. Proximity to central London was key to the development of the area as a residential suburb and it was incorporated into the metropolitan area of London in 1855.

Kenosha is the only Metra station outside of Illinois, as far as 51.6 miles (83.0 km) from Ogilvie Transportation Center. Because it is located outside the RTA’s jurisdiction, the service to the station is partially subsidized by the city of Kenosha. It is the northernmost station of the entire Metra system, making it the most northern station in the entire RTA network. Other commuter services extended from Chicago into Wisconsin but were eventually discontinued. The KD Line ran from Kenosha to Harvard and closed in 1939. The Northwest Line had a branch to Williams Bay that was cut back to Lake Geneva in 1966 and discontinued north of the state line in 1975. The Milwaukee Road had commuter service to Walworth until 1982 when Fox Lake became the present northern terminal.

      <p id="GL277_135_002" num_links="2">Part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, Kent was settled in 1805 and was known for many years as Franklin Mills.  Settlers were attracted to the area due to its location along the Cuyahoga River as a place for water-powered mills.  Later development came in the 1830s and 1840s as a result of the settlement's position along the route of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal. Leading up to the American Civil War, Franklin Mills was noted for its activity in the Underground Railroad.  With the decline of the canal and the emergence of the railroad, the town became the home of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad maintenance shops through the influence of Marvin Kent.  In 1864 the town was renamed Kent in honor of and in gratitude for Marvin Kent's efforts. It was incorporated as a village in 1867 and became a city after the 1920 Census. Today Kent is a college town best known as the home of the main campus of <link wikipedia="Kent_State_University" osm="194552384" type="way">Kent State University</link>, founded in 1910, and as the site of the 1970 <link wikipedia="Kent_State_shootings" osm="420577616" type="way">Kent State shootings</link>.

The library was established in 1892 as the first use of an 1892 Ohio law that allowed municipalities under 5,000 residents to tax residents for library support.  Initially, the library was housed in a downtown Kent business block. Pittsburgh steel industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie offered the then-village of Kent $11,500 for construction of a permanent home for the library in 1901, contingent on a suitable location and voter approval of a tax levy for maintenance. Kent voters approved the measure and town namesake Marvin Kent donated the land. The library opened at its new location on September 26, 1903. The library has undergone several expansions since 1903, with the latest expansion occurring in 2004–06.  During the 2004–06 expansion, the three previous additions to the original Carnegie library were demolished and a new three-story addition was built in their places while the original Carnegie library was renovated and restored. The addition tripled available space to approximately 55,000 square feet (5,100 m2). During construction, the library was housed in Kent's University Plaza shopping center.  The current building and the renovated Carnegie portion opened on September 26, 2006, 103 years after the Carnegie library first opened.[2][3]

During the Ottoman occupation of Crete, the monastery often served as a local revolutionary center and suffered several retaliatory attacks as a result. In 1720, Kera monastery became Stauropegic (independent of the local Bishop).
