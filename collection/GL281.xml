It was a medium-sized great house located 0.5 miles (0.8 km) west of Pueblo Bonito; it shows strong evidence of construction and occupation by Pueblo peoples who migrated to Chaco from the northern San Juan Basin in the time period of 1125 to 1200 (McElmo Phase of Chacoan Architecture). From its masonry work, rectangular shape and design Kletso is identified as Pueblo III architecture by prominent Chaco archaeologists Stephen H. Lekson and Tom Windes.[1] They also argue that this great house was only occupied by one or two households. Fagen writes that Kletso contained around 55 rooms, four ground-floor kivas, and a two-story cylindrical tower that may have functioned as a kiva or religious center. Evidence of an obsidian production industry were discovered here. The house was erected between 1125 and 1130.[2]

Later on, Ivan the Terrible gave Kineshma to Ivan Petrovich Shuisky, but after the latter's death it was returned to the Tsar in 1587. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Kineshma was a major fishing center, which supplied sturgeon for the Tsar's table. In 1608, it was twice ravaged by the Poles. Throughout its history, Kineshma belonged to different Russian regions, including Archangelgorod Governorate, Yaroslavl Province of Saint Petersburg Governorate, and Moscow Governorate.

Machinery from a windmill at <link wikipedia="Coldwaltham" osm="61085308" type="node">Coldwaltham</link> is believed to have been incorporated in the mill. Martin operated the mill and the village shop until he died in 1884. The Mill failed to sell so his wife hired Robert Miller as Miller on her behalf. In 1895 it was sold to Richard Vincent who hired Ernest Powell to be the Miller. The writer Hilaire Belloc bought the mill and the surrounding land in 1906.  Powell continued to be Miller while the mill worked commercially until 1926, latterly by a steam engine.[1] It was bought in 1906 by Hilaire Belloc, who owned it until his death in 1953. King's Mill was restored by E Hole and Sons, the <link wikipedia="Burgess_Hill" osm="17723728" type="node">Burgess Hill</link> millwrights, as a memorial to Belloc soon after his death and was re-opened to visitors for the first time in 1958.[2] West Sussex County Council had the responsibility for the upkeep of the mill, which remained in the ownership of the Belloc family.[1] A local committee the Friends of Shipley Windmill opened the mill to visitors until 1986. Major repairs to the mill were required and County Council agreed with the owners to form a charitable trust to manage the mill.

It was founded in London in 1898.
The school was considered "radical" for its era as it provided a secular education in a co-educational setting.[2] Today it remains true to its roots by providing a holistic educational experience that values equally academic achievement and personal development. It does so within an informal environment characterised by minimal rules that seeks to develop intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivation. In order to enable every individual to flourish, the school seeks to minimize unnecessary pressure and maximise a broad sense of well-being.

It is protected as a nature reserve under the Herefordshire Nature Trust.

      <p id="GL281_185_002" num_links="3">It is uncertain exactly how the cave got its name.

Lawman mentions a castle on Cloard Hill in the district of Hergin, and has Vortigern dying after the castle was besieged and fired by Aurelius and Uther.[6] Helen Hill Miller, in her 1969 book The Realms of Arthur, suggests a military use for the cave, arguing that the cave's "recesses penetrate very far into the hill, and could hide a substantial force".[7] The cave has a parallel with <link wikipedia="Cadbury_Castle,_Somerset" osm="528281300" type="node">Cadbury Castle</link> in that it is a cave within a hillfort.

The asylum, built by Brooklyn to alleviate overcrowding in its own asylums, was a "farm colony" asylum, where patients worked in a variety of farm-related activities, such as feeding livestock and growing food, as this was considered to be a form of therapy.

Holland House in Kent was sold by his third son Charles James Fox and in due course subdivided and further developed.
