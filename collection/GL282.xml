It became New York's first capital in 1777, and was burned by the British on October 13, 1777, after the Battles of Saratoga. In the 19th century, the city became an important transport hub after the discovery of natural cement in the region, and had both railroad and canal connections. Passenger rail service has since ceased, and many of the older buildings are part of three historic districts, including the Stockade District uptown, the Midtown Neighborhood Broadway Corridor, and the Rondout-West Strand Historic District downtown.

At the time, Southwest Point was on the fringe of the legal settlement area for Euro-Americans. A Cherokee village, headed by Chief Tollunteeskee, was situated just across the river, at what is now <link wikipedia="Rockwood,_Tennessee" osm="197176" type="relation">Rockwood</link>. In 1805, Colonel Return J. Meigs, who operated out of Southwest Point, was appointed Cherokee Agent, effectively moving the agency from the Tellico Blockhouse to Southwest Point. The city of Kingston was established on October 23, 1799, as part of an effort to partition <link wikipedia="Knox_County,_Tennessee" osm="1848184" type="relation">Knox County</link> (the initial effort to form a separate county failed, but succeeded two years later).[8]  Kingston was named after Major Robert King, an officer at Fort Southwest Point in the 1790s.[3]

The band was co-founded and headed by <link wikipedia="Viktor_Tsoi" osm="6704394" type="relation">Viktor Tsoi</link>, who wrote the music and lyrics for almost all of the band's songs. Over the course of eight years, Kino had released over 90 songs spanning over seven studio albums, as well as releasing a few compilations and live albums. The band's music was also widely circulated in the form of bootleg recordings. After Tsoi's death in a car accident in 1990, the band shortly broke up after releasing their last album, consisting of songs that Tsoi and the group were working on in the months before his death.

The group consisted of <link wikipedia="Viktor_Tsoi" osm="6704394" type="relation">Viktor Tsoi</link>, guitarist Aleksei Rybin, and drummer Oleg Valinsky. They began rehearsing, but Valinsky was drafted and had to leave the band. In the spring of 1982, they began to perform at the Leningrad Rock Club and met with the influential underground musician Boris Grebenshchikov. It was around this time that they finally changed the band's name to Kino.[1]  The name was chosen because it was considered short and "synthetic," and the band members took pride in that it had only two syllables and was easy to pronounce by speakers all over the world.[2] Tsoi and Rybin said later that they had got the idea for the name itself after having seen a bright cinema sign.[3]

In 1948 the theatre was heavily renovated and served afterward as a speciality cinema in the GDR. After the auditorium had been closed because of the danger of collapse, it was refurbished and reconstructed from 1999 until 2001 in accordance with conservation guidelines. In 2002 the reconstruction was awarded the "German Award for Monument Protection". Since 2001 the Babylon is once again open to the public and used primarily as arthouse cinema, as well as a venue for the Berlinale and musical and literary cultural events. Originally the cinema held 1200 members of audience in one hall, but is today divided into two halls with 450 and 70 seats.

William, Lord Hastings, began work on the castle in 1480, founding it on the site of a pre-existing manor house. William was a favourite of King Edward IV and had prospered considerably during the Wars of the Roses. Work continued quickly until 1483, when William was executed during Richard, Duke of Gloucester's, seizure of the throne. His widow briefly continued the project after his death but efforts then ceased, with the castle remaining largely incomplete. Parts of the castle were inhabited for a period, before falling into ruin during the course of the 17th century. In 1912, the Commissioners of Work took over management of the site, repairing the brickwork and carrying out an archaeological survey. In the 21st century, the castle is controlled by English Heritage and open to visitors.

Originally it was an 'island' of slightly higher land surrounded by boggy country. The village houses are adjacent to the knoll, which is encompassed by the wall of the old churchyard. Some of the earliest history of the local area is represented approximately two kilometres northwest at the village of <link wikipedia="Eassie" osm="5000008573" type="node">Eassie</link>, where the <link wikipedia="Eassie_Stone" osm="5320727476" type="node">Eassie Stone</link> is displayed in a modern transparent shelter in the ruined former parish church; this finely carved Pictish cross-slab probably dates to the first half of the 8th century (Historic Scotland; accessible at all times).

An attraction close to the village is Kirkjugólf ("Church floor"), a natural pavement of basalt. These are basalt columns in the earth, but only the tops can be seen, and as the name suggests, they have the appearance of a paved church floor. This lava formation has similar origins to the Giant's Causeway in Ireland.  All these attractions contribute to Kirkjubæjarklaustur being a popular stopping point for tourists.
