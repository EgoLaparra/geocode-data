It was renamed the John Jacob Astor Hotel in 1951, but a decline in business continued, as did other problems. The building was condemned by the city for safety violations in 1968[3] and sat vacant for several years until 1984, when work to renovate it and convert it for apartments began.  It reopened as an apartment building in 1986,[4] with the lowermost two floors reserved for commercial use.  The building was listed on the NRHP in 1979.[2]  The world's first cable television system was set up in 1948 using an antenna on the roof of the Hotel Astoria.[5]

      <p id="GL285_103_002" num_links="2">Construction began in November 1922 and was completed in late 1923, and the Hotel Astoria opened for business on January 1, 1924.[4]  At the start of construction, the plans called for the hotel to be five stories tall, but only a month later,[4] on December 8, 1922, a fire destroyed almost all of downtown Astoria.[1][6]  The resulting severe shortage of housing prompted the Columbia Hotel Company to revise the design to increase the planned height to eight stories.[4]  The hotel was the tallest building in Oregon outside of <link wikipedia="Portland,_Oregon" osm="1666626393 186579" type="node relation">Portland</link> when completed[1][4] and the tallest commercial structure on the Oregon Coast. Emporis gives its height as 86 feet (26 m).[7] It was eclipsed by the nine-story, 110-foot-tall (34 m)[8] Marshfield Hotel (now the Tioga Hotel), in <link wikipedia="Coos_Bay,_Oregon" osm="150951838 186285" type="node relation">Coos Bay</link>, in 1926, when construction of that building's overall structure neared completion.[9] However, work on the Marshfield was soon suspended, and the building stood vacant (its uppermost stories a windowless shell) until the late 1940s, when it was finally completed and opened for use for the first time, as the Tioga Hotel.[9]  Until the Tioga Hotel's opening in 1948, the Hotel Astoria remained the tallest commercial structure in use on the Oregon Coast.

The Sierra Club, which he co-founded, is a prominent American conservation organization.  In his later life, Muir devoted most of his time to the preservation of the Western forests. As part of the campaign to make Yosemite a national park, Muir published two landmark articles on wilderness preservation in The Century Magazine, "The Treasures of the Yosemite" and "Features of the Proposed Yosemite National Park"; this helped support the push for U.S. Congress to pass a bill in 1890 establishing <link wikipedia="Yosemite_National_Park" osm="1643367" type="relation">Yosemite National Park</link>.[6] The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings has inspired readers, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large nature areas.[7]

A small group of the newly-arrived Germans –Nicolaus Frett, Nicolaus Adams, Jacob Schmitt and Johann Baptist Muller – settled in this Fox Valley region and formed one of the first Catholic parishes (named St. John the Baptist) in all of Illinois in what was then called "Miller's Settlement." In 1842 they built their first church; the site has continually held a parish church since then. The church, a simple log cabin, dually functioned as a school as well as a meeting hall. The first priest to serve this new congregation was delivered there by friendly Indians who found him lost in the woods of Wisconsin. [4] The church served the community until 1850 when a larger frame church was built to replace it. In 1867 a third church was built in the popular Gothic style of Germany. This beautiful church took thirteen years to complete and was the pride of the Johnsburg community until it was tragically destroyed by a great fire on February 19, 1900.[5] So devastating was the fire that many grave markers of the early settlers, in the adjoining cemetery, were destroyed.

It is located in Guntur East mandal of Guntur revenue division. It is  12 km away from Guntur. Due to its proximity to the town the village boasts of many educated people. Jonnalagadda  is a politically active village and the first Assembly Speaker of Andhra Pradesh, Mr Nallapati Venkata Ramaiah comes from this village. Jonnalagadda is a perfect village with soils suitable to grow  rice and rainfed crops, and dairy, temples, Kalyana Mandapam (contributed by TTD), schools and Pharma and engineering colleges. There are 7 temples in the village i.e. Sai baba temple, Vinayaka temple, Venugopala swamy temple, Anjeneya swamy temple, Sivalayam, Poleramma temple and Gangamma temple besides Boddurai where prayers are offered on special occasions. As per the inscription available at the premises, the Venugopala swamy temple was constructed by a chieftain of Kakatiya Rudramadevi, in reciprocation to the comfortable treatment for his army during one of his endeavours by the then village chief Sri Jonnalagadda Verri Ragaiah.  It has been renovated since then. Sai baba temple, though recent, has gained importance among the residents of Jonnalagada as well as Narasaroapet. It has become a custom to celebrate Sai baba Thirunala (fair) every year on May 18. It is a huge festival in Jonnalagada. Many people from different places, from near and far,  participate in the proceedings on that day. Four famous engineering colleges are there near the village. Every sankranthi festival is celebrated by conducting sports, games and yedla pandalu (bull racing), in which many people from nearby villages also take part and enjoy. Every festival is celebrated with pomp and show.  One of the major festivals is Vinayaka chavithi. Children enjoy identifying and collecting herbs for puja, preparing Ganesh idols with clay, performing puja and immersing the God in Kuppagunji vagu. Occasionally, Poleramma and Gangamma jataras are performed. 
Jonnalagadda stands as an example for communal amity with a church (since 1952) and a mosque. Chritmas and Ramjan are celebrated with equal fervor. Jonnalagadda has a satellite village, Rangareddy Palem.
Jonnalagadda village also stands as a mute witness to the exploitation of colonial British, with 3 pairs of abandoned Neelimandu bavulu (wells) used for processing blue, cultivation of which must have rendered many fertile lands useless. These wells still can be seen behind Poleramma temple.

Jons Kapel can be seen from the beach, north of the point where the path reaches the coast. The cliffs consist of Vang granite, named after the fishing village of <link wikipedia="Vang,_Bornholm" osm="297671640" type="node">Vang</link>, just to the north. The cliff has several caves.  Jon's Cave is high above the sea. North of the cave, there is an almost vertical rockface known as Hvidkleven (White Cliff). The caves to the south are known as Jons Sovekammer (Jon's Bedroom), Jons Sakristi, Jons Spisestue (Jon's Dining Room) and Jons Madkælder (Jon's Food Cellar).[6] The bluff has been identified into three climbing grades depending on the difficulty level, at 10 metres (33 ft) intervals. Kangaroo Point, at 10 metres (33 ft) from the base level, is Grade 3, and is one of the better and secure routes. The second level, called Alle Veje fører til Hasle ("All roads lead to Hasle"), is also Grade 3 .The third, known as the Udsigten ("the prospect"), is Grade 4.[6]
