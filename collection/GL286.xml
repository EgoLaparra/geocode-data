In 1851, a group of prospectors moved to the <link wikipedia="Illinois_River_(Oregon)" osm="7140456" type="relation">Illinois Valley</link> and made the first discovery of gold in Southern Oregon.

It is named after Sgt. Joshua Eaton, the only Reading casualty in the American Revolutionary War. The school is located at the corner of Summer Avenue and Oak Street, close to the site of Joshua Eaton's family home. In 1944, Dr. William K. Wilson, supervisor of educational planning of school buildings for the New York State Education Department, was hired to study the Reading school system. One of his observations was that an elementary school was needed in the area of Prescott Street, Main Street and the railroad tracks. His recommendation was that the school should plan to accommodate 500 children from kindergarten through grade six. When Joshua Eaton opened in 1949, it housed grades 1-6. Today, it houses around 450 children in kindergarten through fifth grade. The building was designed by reading architect George Sidebottom. The original building consisted of 18 classrooms, an auditorium, cafeteria and gymnasium. At that time, the school was chosen as the best-designed elementary school building in the nation (38,000 blueprints were submitted).  Joshua Eaton was dedicated on Sunday, October 23, 1949.

He had been a royalist until 1822, but switched sides and joined Lanza's insurrectionist army at the age of 18. His advance in the Bolivian army was unremarkable, although his role was apparently fundamental to the Confederate triumph over Salaverry at the Battle of Socabaya (early 1836). Importantly, he had been a supporter of Santa Cruz in the 1830s. His golden hour came, and he rose dramatically to the occasion, when at aged 37 and as Bolivian Army chief he united the pro-Velasco and pro-Santa Cruz factions under his command to face-off a massive Peruvian invasion led by President Agustín Gamarra. At the <link wikipedia="Battle_of_Ingavi" osm="2145192906" type="node">Battle of Ingavi</link> (November 1841), Ballivián emerged with a surprising and crushing victory against Gamarra, whom he took prisoner and ordered executed. It was a stunning turn of events, and one that marks the highest point in Bolivian military history. Ingavi preserved Bolivian independence and transformed Ballivián into an overnight hero in a fractured nation badly in need of one. Congress almost immediately proclaimed him Provisional President in Calvo's replacement. Marshall Santa Cruz, from France, acquiesced to his rule and declined to return in the face of the enormous popularity of the new Caudillo.

His parents enrolled him in the Colegio de San Bernardino, to pursue religious studies, but Artigas refused to submit to the school's strict discipline. Before he left the school, he developed a strong friendship with Fernando Otorgues, who would work with him in later years.[3] At the age of 12, he moved to the countryside and worked on his family's farms. His contact with the customs and perspectives of gauchos and Indians made a great impression on him.[4] Once he had come of age, he distanced himself from his parents and became involved in cattle smuggling. This made him a wanted man among the owners of haciendas and with the government in Montevideo. A reward was put out for his death.[5]

Encouraged by his mother, Mariana, Perales sang  at some local festivals in his hometown.
However, it was not until he met Rafael Trabucchelli (an influential Italian music producer in Spain at the time) in 1970 that his musical career took a dramatic turn. Trabucchelli discovered the young composer and talented, but reluctant, singer. Perales composed "Porque te vas" (Because you are leaving), which was performed by Jeanette and sold 4 million copies worldwide in 1976. After much encouragement from Trabucchelli and his supporters, Perales decided to give singing a try.  His first record, "Celos de mi Guitarra" (Jealous of my Guitar) was a huge success in Spain and in Latin America.

The ancient Maya site of Joya de Cerén is located in the Zapotitán Valley 36 kilometers northwest of <link wikipedia="San_Salvador" osm="197701710 6462027" type="node relation">San Salvador</link>, El Salvador.[1] It is often referred to as the "<link wikipedia="Pompeii" osm="4753980853" type="node">Pompeii</link> of the Americas", in comparison to the famed Ancient Roman ruins. This site is known for the excellent preservation of a Classic period settlement that was rapidly buried by the ashfall of an eruption of the Loma Caldera around A.D. 600.[2] The relative abundance of paleoethnobotanical remains recovered at Joya de Cerén in comparison to other ancient Maya archaeological sites make Joya de Cerén particularly significant in the study of everyday life of ancient Maya agricultural communities. Of importance was the discovery of a manioc field, the first instance of manioc cultivation identified at a New World archaeological site.[3] The site was thought to have been settled between A.D. 200 and A.D. 600.[4] Joya de Cerén was entered on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1993 and is a major tourist attraction in El Salvador.[5]

</p>
      <p id="GL286_327_002" num_links="2">1,400 years before the village was abandoned, the population was estimated to be 200 people.[6] The eruption of the <link wikipedia="San_Salvador_(volcano)" osm="2601741115" type="node">Loma Caldera volcano</link> caused 10 meters of pyroclastic debris to settle over the site.[7][8] The site was remarkably well preserved due to the low temperature of ash and very fast ashfall, a 4 - 8 meter thick layer having blanketed the town in the space of a few hours. The use of plaster casting by archaeologists similar to the one used in <link wikipedia="Pompeii" osm="4753980853" type="node">Pompeii</link> assisted in their identification of fruiting plants, abundance of beans in storage, and mature maize to predict the eruption happened in August or September.[9] Guava, agave, cacao, and manioc were some of the major crops to the community.[10] Based on crack patterns observed from the relatively earthquake-resistant wattle-and-daub walls and adobe columns at Joya de Cerén, scholars suggest that an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale preceded the eruption, giving residents time to flee the site.[11] Further, possible steamy emissions from the volcano may have alerted residents of the impending danger, but only inferences can be made about what exactly warned them.[12] It is unclear to scholars if the duration of the eruptions lasted a few days or a few weeks.[13] 
The position of artifacts at the site have led scholars to suggest that the evacuation of Joya de Cerén happened in the early evening: shovels and other agricultural work equipment were found stored near the domestic structures, and fires had been lit in hearths. [14] Also, sleeping mats had not yet been rolled out on the domicile floor. [15] No human remains have been discovered at the ancient Maya site.[16]

Regarded as one of the least contaminated lakes in Stockholm, Judarn receives storm water from a nearby traffic route which gives it considerable levels of lead resulting in a bathing ban, metal content otherwise being low and phosphorus levels moderate.[2]  The lake, considered as being of great recreational and natural value, is part of the nature reserve Judarskogen and has a rich flora and fauna with many aquatic plants, birds, and frogs.  Its isolated location combined with low levels of chlorophyll makes Judarn one of the clearest lakes in Stockholm, and notwithstanding low levels of oxygen nutrient content is low even during winters, with raised levels of PAH and PCB in deep sediments.[3]

It was built by the city of Vienna under the Mayor Michael Häupl, after Rachel Whiteread's design was chosen unanimously by an international jury under the leadership of the architect Hans Hollein. The members of the jury were Michael Haupl, Ursula Pasterk, Hannes Swoboda, Amnon Barzel, Phyllis Lambert, Sylvie Liska, Harald Szeemann, George Weidenfeld, Simon Wiesenthal, and Robert Storr. Individuals and teams of artists and architects from Austria, Israel, Great Britain and the United States were invited to the competition. They were Valie Export; <link wikipedia="Karl_Prantl_(sculptor)" osm="1806604113" type="node">Karl Prantl</link> and Peter Waldbauer as a team; Zbynek Sekal; Heimo Zobernig, working with Michael Hofstatter and Wolfgang Pauzenberger; Michael Clegg and Martin Guttman as a team; Ilya Kabakov; Rachel Whiteread; and Peter Eisenman.[1] The submissions had to take into account the design constraints of the site at Judenplatz, and texts including a memorial inscription and the listing of all concentration camps in which Austrian Jews were killed.[2][3]

Kearns married Judge's niece, Jennie Judge. Judge Mercy Home, more commonly called Judge Miner's Home, was designed by architect David C. Dart. The hospital was established for the population of Catholic coal miners working in Park City who suffered from black lung. As the need for a hospital dedicated to this cause subsided in direct relation to the decline of coal mining east of Salt Lake, Mary Judge (who along with her deceased husband, John, was the benefactor of the hospital) expressed her wishes to the bishop of the Diocese of Salt Lake to reopen the medical facility as a school. Mary Judge died before the diocese opened the new school's doors. The cornerstone was laid by Bishop Scanlan in the fall of 1902 but the hospital was not opened until the fall of 1910. The hospital was originally intended to provide medical treatment for aged and infirm miners. Many miners working in <link wikipedia="Park_City,_Utah" osm="198864" type="relation">Park City</link> suffered from silicosis, also known as "miners' consumption", the disease that killed Mary's husband John at the age of 48.[2] With <link wikipedia="Salt_Lake_Regional_Medical_Center" osm="459884061" type="way">Holy Cross Hospital</link> a few blocks away, the need for a miners' hospital was not great; it was remodeled and opened as a school in the fall of 1920, under the name "Cathedral School."
