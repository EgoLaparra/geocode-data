It is a jettied timber-frame building of three storeys, occupying a corner plot on the town square. The building has served a variety of purposes with shops on the ground floor and workshops and living quarters on the first and second floors. At one time part of the building was occupied by the King's Head Inn; a sculpture of a king's head, which acted as a sign for the pub, is preserved within and a replica is attached to the outside. The lodge was bequeathed to the <link wikipedia="National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty" osm="143436969" type="way">National Trust</link> in 1971, and repairs were undertaken to reverse significant deterioration to the building.

Wright designed the house for Arthur Miller's wife, Marilyn Monroe (1926–1962), but Miller and Monroe divorced soon after and the project was abandoned.  The Arthur Miller house design was a modification of two previous unbuilt projects—the Raúl Baillères house (1952) and before it, the Robert F. Windfohr house (1949), also known as the "Crownfield" house.[4]

Found listed on French explorer maps as “Connoconoque,” the name “Kinniconick” is believed to be of Shawnee origin, either meaning “willow bark,” or referring to the supposed Shawnee word for a kind of tobacco, a mixture of aromatic leaves and bark. However, this is not certain. As settlers followed and opened up the West, the creek became known as Kinniconick. The Kinniconick post office [2] is closed. The Kinniconick School is also closed.

They began rehearsing, but Valinsky was drafted and had to leave the band. In the spring of 1982, they began to perform at the Leningrad Rock Club and met with the influential underground musician Boris Grebenshchikov. It was around this time that they finally changed the band's name to Kino.[1]  The name was chosen because it was considered short and "synthetic," and the band members took pride in that it had only two syllables and was easy to pronounce by speakers all over the world.[2] Tsoi and Rybin said later that they had got the idea for the name itself after having seen a bright cinema sign.[3]

After the auditorium had been closed because of the danger of collapse, it was refurbished and reconstructed from 1999 until 2001 in accordance with conservation guidelines. In 2002 the reconstruction was awarded the "German Award for Monument Protection". Since 2001 the Babylon is once again open to the public and used primarily as arthouse cinema, as well as a venue for the Berlinale and musical and literary cultural events.
