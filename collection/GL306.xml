      <p id="GL306_003_001" num_links="2">The village of Lajoskomárom was settled by the aristocratic Batthyány family in 1802. Its name is derived from the name of its founder Lajos Batthyány and from the neighbouring village of Mezőkomárom, to which the area of Lajoskomárom used to belong. The settlers were of three different ethnicities (Germans, Hungarians and Slovaks). The biggest group were the Donauschwaben, most of whom were Lutherans with a Catholic minority. They didn't come directly from abroad, but rather from areas in modern-day Hungary already settled by ethnic Germans, most notably from Pusztavám and <link wikipedia="Tolna_County" osm="2781485825 22239" type="node relation">Tolna county</link>. The second ones in terms of population were the Hungarians, who belonged to three distinct denominations (<link wikipedia="Catholic_Church" osm="618656792" type="way">Catholicism</link>, Lutheranism, Calvinism) and who arrived from various areas of Western Hungary. The Slovaks were uniformly Lutheran and mostly originated from Oroszlány. The three church towers in the crest of the village, symbolize the three denominations historically and currently present in the community.

The water in the lake is refreshed with pumps bringing water from the adjoining harbour through filters intended to prevent marine organisms from entering. This system has succeeded in keeping large predators such as saltwater crocodiles and bull sharks, and the deadly box jellyfish. However the lake has been closed to swimming twice, once due to a large Orange-spotted grouper and once due to an outbreak of a stinging species of Cassiopea jelly fish.[1]

The water flowing in from Araz enriches the lake with chlorides and has high mineralization. It is argued that throughout the ages, the rivers have flooded the area creating depressions and then refilled them with water. Before the 20th century, Ağgöl was already partially fed by drainage waters from irrigated fields. The volume of water in the lake had fluctuated in the past when it faced being dried out in single years and when it reached very high volumes of water in other years. When the <link wikipedia="Mingachevir" osm="227052744 3812581" type="node relation">Mingachevir</link> dam was built in the mid 20th century, the water regime in the Mil steppe and Kura-Araz lowland changed. From 1960, the water to the lake inflowed only from saline water collectors built in the region to drain irrigation waters. In the present, the lake is fed by "K-2" and "K-3" collectors. Some areas around the lake have been used as pasture grounds. Other areas were transformed into irrigated agricultural lands used to grow cotton, wheat, lucerne, vegetables and wine.[3]

The lake was originally known as "Grass Lake" and once lay in the center of a marsh surrounded by pastureland as well as apple and cherry orchards. Grass Lake was one of the so-called "triplet lakes" lying along M-44. Its sister lakes to the east are Silver Lake and Bostwick Lake. Developed by the Velting family contractors in the mid-1970s, Grass Lake was expanded and a large dike was added to the western edge to raise the water level. Residential and commercial development was soon constructed and in the early 21st century, a lakeside suburban sub-division also called "Lake Bella Vista" functions very much as a community. Lake Bella Vista is bordered by M-44, (Belding Road), on the south, and Blakely Road on the east. To the south are the Lockhart family orchards and the beginning of the Stout Creek watershed which cuts through forest-concealed glacial dunes bordering the Woodbrook area.[citation needed]

It is notable for its relatively great depth for the region - 50 metres (160 ft) - created as a deep gouge in the landscape in the most recent glaciation.[1]  The lake is located in the Meshchyera Lowlands, a glacial alluvial plain of swampy lowlands, gravelly moraines and limestone bedrock.[2] It was once connected by an artificial canal to Lake Velikoye ("Grand Lake", a much larger lake with a surface area of 20 square kilometres (7.7 sq mi)).  The canal was filled in 2009.   Lake Beloye is surrounded by pine forests, with reeds and sedge predominating on the shore.  It is a popular lake for recreation and fishing, being home to pike, carp and other fish.

The standpipe was a popular form of water tower from about 1860 to the turn of the 20th-century.[2] The city council first attempted to build it as early as 1890, but the $10,000 bond was rejected.  An $8,000 bond issue passed in June 1893, and a Water Works Department was established.  The city contracted with the A.F. Paige Company of <link wikipedia="Sioux_City,_Iowa" osm="151408655 1910970545" type="node node">Sioux City</link> to build the tower, which is 90 feet (27 m) tall and a diameter of 12 feet (4 m).[2]  It was completed in November 1893.  Water mains were laid the following year and water was delivered to most citizens of Lake City.  It also allowed the city to provide adequate fire protection.  A new water tank was built next to the standpipe in the 1920s.  It has subsequently been replaced by a larger structure on the southeast side of town.  The standpipe was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.[1]

This resulting reservoir is a long and narrow lake approximately 3.5 miles long and 300 feet wide in some areas.[1] The lake and surrounding area is owned by the United States Bureau of Reclamation and managed by California Department of Parks and Recreation.

A popular hiking, running, and mountain biking trail courses from the dam area, continues downstream below the 730 ft (223 m) in height Foresthill Bridge, linking Lake Clementine to the North and Middle Forks American River Confluence area below the dam.

It is Columbia's third and largest lake.[3][4] Its main features are a small dam and a park with a picnic pavilion and a two-mile (3 km) walking path around the lake. The path was built in 1982.[5] It is surrounded by a park and townhouses. The lake, which was built in 1974, is named for the Elkhorn branch of the <link wikipedia="Patuxent_River" osm="1347686 1357743" type="relation relation">Little Patuxent River</link>. In 1969, Spiro Agnew proclaimed the arrival of the first Columbia based scientific firm, Hittman Associates that relocated for favorable lease rates from Howard Research and Development.[6][7] Hittman in turn was contracted by the EPA using <link wikipedia="Wilde_Lake,_Columbia,_Maryland" osm="1583135" type="relation">Wilde Lake</link> as an example to recommend reuse of storm water runoff from all of Columbia's reservoir systems for residential drinking water to save on development costs.[8][9]
The lake is overseen by the Columbia Association. The lake's location behind many townhouses, though considered an attractive feature to homeowners, has raised concern following the drowning of a small child on September 2, 2005. A drowning occurred in 1980 and a maintenance worker drowned in March 1991.[10][11] A movement was started soon after to erect a fence around playground next to the lake, but the community was split over this need, and a consultant concluded a fence was not necessary.[12][13][14] The lake remained free of incidents until the 8 October 2013 when a body of a 32-year-old was found dead in the lake.[15]

In 1959, on the river flowing out of Lake a hydroelectric power plant was built. This led to the raising of the water level (as the lake began to function as a reservoir). Raising the water level leads to erosion of its banks. The lake is dated to the Glacial period and is about 10,000 years. The largest settlement on the bank of the lake is Ezerische a settlement located on the western shore of the lake. On one of the islands in Lake located Ezerishche Castle.

The lake, originally called George's Lake was later changed to Lake George when the post office opened. The lake itself freezes mostly solid in the wintertime, which made it ideal for railroad men to cut large blocks of ice from it in order to keep perishables cool. A privately owned ice company here supplied the needs of much of the Pikes Peak region. Ice cut during the winter was shipped on the CM to both Colorado Springs and the <link wikipedia="Cripple_Creek,_Colorado" osm="112377" type="relation">Cripple Creek, Colorado</link> district.[8] Also related to the town's railroading history, a short walk into the surrounding hills reveals Chinese bread ovens, from the period their labor was imported.  At the turn of the century the community's population was 30.[8] After 1900 some farmers and ranchers nearby began raising high-altitude potatoes on a limited scale.  This furnished the CM with some additional traffic.[8] However, the CM closed in August 1918.  Other railways then provided service to certain shippers along the otherwise idle CM railway.[9]  Up to that time this had been the shortest rail route through the mountains.  Keeping the track open during winter proved expensive, and when the mining of ore dwindled, the tracks were torn up.  <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_24_in_Colorado" osm="121136" type="relation">U.S. Highway 24</link> follows the abandoned grade of the CM railway.[10] By 1941 the community had grown to 100 persons and was the center of an extensive potato growing area.[10] The community's population in 1965 was 100.[8]
