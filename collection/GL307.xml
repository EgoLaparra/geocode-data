The lake's primary purpose is to store water for pumping into two aqueducts. Prior to the dam construction, the area was home to the Mohave Indians. The lake was named (in 1939) after the Mojave word for blue.[1] In the early 19th century, it was frequented by beaver trappers.[citation needed] Spaniards also began to mine the areas along the river.[citation needed]

It was created to serve the needs of a power utility (Duke Energy) as well as public recreational purposes. It is approximately 26 miles (42 km) long, 3 miles (4.8 km) wide, with an average depth of 54 feet (16 m), and a shoreline measured at 300 miles (480 km) in total,[2] and is approximately 800 feet (240 m) above sea level. It began in 1971 as a massive demolition and building project, including the construction of two large dams––Keowee Dam and Little River Dam––and covered 18,372 acres (74.35 km2)[4][5] of the state. The lake collects or impounds waters from the Keowee River and the Little River and others, and the outflows below the respective dams join to form the <link wikipedia="Seneca_River_(South_Carolina)" osm="8262568" type="relation">Seneca River</link> which flows into the larger <link wikipedia="Savannah_River" osm="163679065 8261816" type="way relation">Savannah River</link>. Lake water helps to cool Duke Energy's three nuclear reactors located at the <link wikipedia="Oconee_Nuclear_Station" osm="384686110" type="way">Oconee Nuclear Generating Station</link>. In addition, the force of falling water through gravity helps generate hydroelectric power. The Keowee Hydro Station generates 158 megawatts from the lake's outflows. In addition, Lake Keowee has been touted as a recreational destination for fishing, boating, swimming, sailing, kayaking and other watersports, and the lake has been described as having pure and clean water. The name Keowee (ᎨᎣᏫ) is a Cherokee name roughly translated as "place of the mullberries." The former Keowee River, which was inundated by Lake Keowee, had been part of the Cherokee Lower Towns region, and Keowee Town had been located on the bank of the Keowee River.

      <p id="GL307_100_002" num_links="5">Before European settlement in <link wikipedia="North_America" osm="36966063" type="node">North America</link>, the Native American nation of the Cherokee lived in the area and had a settlement called Keowee town along what they called the Keowee River. It was capital of the Eastern or Lower Cherokees.  In 1753, white settlers built Fort Prince George across the river from Keowee Town. The Cherokee were historical allies of the British Crown, and were left on their own and defeated after the British loss at Sullivan's Island in 1776.  After being decimated by a large force of the Continental Army and South Carolina militia under the command of Colonel Andrew Williamson, the Cherokee from the Carolina highlands and Georgia petitioned for peace.  The Treaty of Dewitt's Corner, signed May 20, 1777, stipulated the new border to be the crest of the Oconee Mountains, and the Cherokee ceded almost all the land in modern <link wikipedia="Oconee_County,_South_Carolina" osm="1357530" type="relation">Oconee</link>, <link wikipedia="Pickens_County,_South_Carolina" osm="1356994" type="relation">Pickens</link>, <link wikipedia="Anderson_County,_South_Carolina" osm="1357072" type="relation">Anderson</link>, and <link wikipedia="Greenville_County,_South_Carolina" osm="1357004" type="relation">Greenville</link> counties of South Carolina.  The Hopewell Treaty of 1785 and others reaffirmed those boundaries, while clarifying access for the bordering Cherokee to continue to use the hunting grounds along the mountainous slopes of the border that technically fell into the land of the white settlers. In the treaty of Washington of 1816, the Cherokee sold this remaining strip of land and its hunting grounds to the United States for $5,000 and relocated to points west in Georgia. The land that eventually became the extreme northern border of modern Lake Keowee was never again contested. Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced the Cherokee to depart the region, and one estimate was that up to 4,000 of 16,000 Cherokee died from disease, exposure and starvation on what became known as the Trail of Tears.

The lake immediately south of Lake Kulundinskoye is mauve-colored, contrasting with the oval, dark blue lake along the northwest edge of the photograph. Two deltas can be observed along the eastern side of Lake Kulundinskoye. The white areas are probably salty minerals that were deposited on the surface as water evaporated. A well-established shelter belt system (a series of three parallel lines adjoining end to end) runs generally north-south along the eastern side of Lake Kulundinskoye to form a manmade barrier to help protect against wind erosion. The cultivated field patterns are large and basically rectangular in shape.

It is part of the Poroto Mountains and the northern rim of the caldera is the highest point in the range. The caldera mostly composed from trachytic and phonolitic lavas. Ngozi is a Holocene caldera that generated the Kitulo pumice 12,000 years ago during a Plinian eruption, most likely in the same eruption that generated the caldera. Other eruption deposits are the Ngozi Tuff (less than thousand years ago) and the Ituwa Surge base surge deposits of uncertain age, but intermediary to the Kitulo pumice and Ngozi Tuff. The youngest activity generated a pyroclastic flow that flowed southwards for 10 km around 1450 CE. Some pyroclastic cones surround the volcano. The walls of the caldera are forested, with the exception of segments scoured by landslides and high cliffs that inhibit access to the water. The inner caldera is forested with Maesa lanceolata, Albizia gummifera and Hagenia abyssinica, far fewer tree species than neighbouring mountains consistent with the recent geological origin of the volcano. The caldera itself is not subjected to hydrothermal activity, but large subaqueous CO2 emissions and local legends of the killing power of the lake indicate a danger of limnic eruptions. The lake floor according to echosounding is flat and has no terraces.[2][3][4]

In 2014, the government of Nicaragua offered a 50-year concession to the Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co. (HKND) to build a canal across Nicaragua at a cost of US$40 billion, with construction beginning in December 2014 and completing in 2019.[4] Protests against the ecological and social effects of the canal as well as questions about financing have led to doubts about the project.[5]
