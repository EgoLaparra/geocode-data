Lake Roy is connected by a canal on its southwest side to <link wikipedia="Lake_Lulu" osm="83582263" type="way">Lake Lulu</link> and indirectly from there to more than twenty other area lakes.

Located in the San Juan Mountains at an elevation of 9,003 feet (2,744 m), the freshwater lake is 2.1 miles (3.4 km) long, up to 89 feet (27 m) deep, has a surface area of 0.52 square miles (1.3 km2), and holds about 11,000 acre feet (14,000,000 m3) of water.[2]  The town of <link wikipedia="Lake_City,_Colorado" osm="6915189" type="relation">Lake City</link>, a few miles to the north, is named after Lake San Cristobal.[3] The name San Cristóbal means <link wikipedia="Saint_Christopher" osm="832473638 1326694419" type="node node">Saint Christopher</link> in the Spanish language.

Natural landslide dams are usually short-lived, but some have been known to fail after long periods—131 years in the case of Lake Yashinkul in the former Soviet Union.  This prompted the United States Geological Survey to investigate the possibility that the Lake San Cristobal dam might fail.  Based on its non-porous composition and the fact that part of the dam's natural spillway is actually cut into bedrock and not the material deposited by the landslide, the USGS concluded the dam is stable. Sediments washing down via the Lake Fork and Slumgullion Creek are slowly filling in the lake, but are not expected to affect the dam's stability. If sedimentation continues at the past rate, the lake will have completely filled with sediment in about 2,500 years.[2]

Beginning in 1962 it had a few airline flights: the first were by Futura Airlines[1], an intrastate airline, and by Paradise Airlines with both airlines flying Lockheed L-049 Constellations. Paradise ceased operations after a fatal accident in the mountains near Lake Tahoe and Pacific Air Lines arrived in 1964 with Fairchild F-27 turboprop service.  That summer, Lake Tahoe was a stop on an F-27 "milk run":  Pacific flight 771 operating a routing of Reno-Lake Tahoe-Sacramento-San Francisco-San Jose-Fresno-Bakersfield-Los Angeles-San Diego.  In 1966 Pacific started the first jet service to Lake Tahoe with Boeing 727-100s flying Los Angeles (<link wikipedia="Los_Angeles_International_Airport" osm="649268639" type="way">LAX</link>)-San Jose-Lake Tahoe. A 1966 Pacific Air Lines route map depicted nonstop 727 service to San Francisco (<link wikipedia="San_Francisco_International_Airport" osm="545819287" type="way">SFO</link>) and Reno.[2]  This 727 service lasted less than a year, and Lake Tahoe did not see scheduled jets again until 1983 as scheduled airline jet service was then banned after Pacific ended its 727 flights into the airport. Flights with turboprop and prop aircraft continued with Pacific Air Lines resuming Fairchild F-27 turboprop service.  Pacific Air Lines successors Air West and Hughes Airwest served the airport with the F-27 until the early 1970s.

It is relatively small, only about 100 m across, and varies in size as the water level rises and falls. At high water levels a small outlet stream appears at the northwest end, but it is absorbed into the ground after a short distance. The name means "swirling water" in Hawaiian, though it is usually rather placid. It usually freezes in winter, but aquatic insects such as midges and beetles can be found breeding in the water.

This act has caused a lot of controversy in the area[citation needed] mainly because of residents' concerns about the water flow over the waterfall into the Mill River. Because of this, the regional water authority has agreed to extract only enough water to satisfy the need and change these levels depending upon the season. They also agreed to install a pump to ensure the flow of water over the dam at all times and are currently building a fish ladder to allow fish to swim upriver.

It was officially classified as an area "Ramsar", which involves protection of this location. Several studies have been conducted on water and soil of the region Fetzara [1-7]. These studies were carried out to monitor the salinity and to highlight its origins and factors governing it. The main objective of this study was to evaluate soil properties of Fetzara Lake that are affected by the phenomenon of salinization and to study their variation with depth. The samples were taken on the first two layers (0–20 cm and 20–40 cm) at eight points around the Fetzara Lake, for a total of 16 samples. The analytical results indicate that soil salinity has reached its maximum in the northeast (region of Wadi Zied) and south of Lake (region of Cheurfa) with a dominance of sodium chloride-chemical facies.

In July 1732, Dr. Charles Carroll of Annapolis was granted a patent out of the Land Office of Maryland for property he named "Georgia."  This grant had been surveyed for him in November 1731.  Though the survey recited 2360 acres, Georgia was later found to contain 2481.9 acres. He would call his grant the "Georgia Plantation." See history and a copy of "Georgia Plantation Map at Mount Clare Museum House.  Carroll's Georgia Plantation covered the present-day neighborhoods of Westport, Mount Winans, <link wikipedia="Morrell_Park,_Baltimore" osm="158653682" type="node">Morrell Park</link>, and <link wikipedia="Violetville,_Baltimore" osm="158242986" type="node">Violetville</link>. Carroll deeded the Westport tracts over to the Baltimore Iron Works Company, a partnership of which he was managing partner and included, among other partners, his distant cousins Daniel Carroll of Duddington and Charles Carroll of Annapolis, who was then Attorney General of Provincial Maryland and who would in 1737 become the father of Charles Carroll of Carrollton.

After its second stop in Lakeland, the train continues on a bit further east along its previous route and then finally turns north toward New York or south toward Miami. Passengers disembarking at Lakeland station do so before the train heads to Tampa and passengers boarding at Lakeland only do so after the train returns from Tampa.[Note 1] This logical arrangement allows passengers boarding or debarking at the Lakeland station to avoid having to make an unnecessary trip to Tampa before continuing on their way.
