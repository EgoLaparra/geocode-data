The majority of district facilities, including the main office, are located on a campus located south of Washington State Route 531 in North Lakewood.

      <p id="GL309_055_002" num_links="3">Lakewood School District 306 was formed in 1914 by consolidating three smaller school districts formed between 1891 and 1909.

School District 65 was formed on November 12, 1892 and served 30 students in the <link wikipedia="Lake_Goodwin,_Washington" osm="238107" type="relation">Lake Goodwin</link> area. School District 102, the newest and smallest district in the area, was formed on September 25, 1909 and served 20 students in Smokey Point.[2] The new district served 70 students from grades one to eleven in a three-story schoolhouse and sent its high school students to the nearby Arlington School District beginning in 1958. The schoolhouse was demolished in 1958 and students were moved to a new campus consisting of two wings and eight classrooms, later expanded to include a gymnasium and eleven classrooms by 1966. The campus was renovated into Lakewood Elementary School while older students were moved to an adjacent junior high school, now Lakewood Middle School, in 1972. The school district built its first high school, now <link wikipedia="Lakewood_High_School_(Washington)" osm="356551584" type="node">Lakewood High School</link> in 1983 and graduated its first senior class the following year.[3][4] The school district re-organized its schools in 1988, converting Lakewood Elementary into Lakewood Primary School, serving grades K–3, and converting the junior high school into Lakewood Intermediate School, serving grades 4–6. A bond issue was passed in 1992 to fund the construction of <link wikipedia="Lakewood_School_District_(Washington)" osm="293159722" type="way">English Crossing Elementary School</link>, opened in 1995 serving grades 3–5.[5] The primary school was renamed back to Lakewood Elementary and served grades K–2, while the intermediate school was converted back to Lakewood Middle School after an extensive remodeling, serving grades 6–8.[6][7] Cougar Creek Elementary School was completed in 2003 to supplement the two other elementary schools by serving grades K–5.[8][9] All three elementary schools were re-organized in 2011 to serve grades K–5 in all three schools, with Lakewood Elementary retaining its preschool program.[10]

The main, upright, portion of the house was constructed in 1838 and the wing section was added to the home during the 1860s. It passed through the hands of several owners until it was purchased by Phillip C. Lampert who is responsible for the wildflower covered lawn. The property contains five types of rare plants and is semi-wooded, shaded by 32 trees. The home is a distinct example of Upright and Wing construction, though it retains some elements of the Greek Revival style it was originally designed in. The wing section of the house features a front porch decorated with Gothic Revival and Queen Anne style elements. The house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance in 2005.

He was also the first teacher at the city's first school in 1838, Newton Academy, located a few blocks from the Lampert-Wildflower House. By 1840, Whitman was named Belvidere's first postmaster as well as Boone County's first circuit clerk and recorder. In October 1846, Whitman stepped down as Reverend at the local church because of ill-health.
