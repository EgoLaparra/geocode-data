It is known for the Lanckorona Castle, today in ruins. Lanckorona is also known for the Battle of the Bar Confederation that took place at the Lanckorona Castle and within a 4 km (2 mi) range south of the town borders on 22 February 1771. In recent years, Lanckorona has become a tourist attraction for the well preserved 19th century wooden houses in its centre. The township of Lanckorona was established by <link wikipedia="Casimir_III_the_Great" osm="2519994" type="relation">Casimir III the Great</link> in 1336, to protect the road to Kraków, following the creation of new regional borders following the homage given by Mieszko I, Duke of Cieszyn to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia in 1291. Lanckorona lost its town rights on 13 July 1933 as its population declined.[1]

It was an important centre of the flax and linen industries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Landerneau is also the hometown of Édouard Leclerc, a businessman and entrepreneur who founded the French supermarket chain E.Leclerc in 1948. His first store applies a hard competition with other supermarket chains with local made products and lower prices. Leclerc's new methods of sales are still applied in all supermarkets and hypermarkets and marks an evolution in the market's history. The town is actually the heart of the agricultural market in northwest Brittany with several agribusiness companies headquarters located in the town.

Duke Albrecht, inspired by his wife Marie Elisabeth established a theatre hall in the Zeughaus [de] (armoury) building. In 1764, Duke Ernst Friedrich established another theatre, in the former Ballhaus (today the location of the Arkaden [de]), but no continuous stage work ensued. Only in 1827, when Duke Ernst I founded the Herzoglich-Sächsisches Hoftheater (ducal Saxon court theatre) was a permanent theatrical ensemble hired. The location was still the Ballhaus which soon turned out to be insufficient. Thus a new building was erected on Schlossplatz across from <link wikipedia="Ehrenburg_Palace" osm="5541544 5541633" type="relation relation">Ehrenburg Palace</link>.

Much of the original work is intact. Examples remain of all major parts of the fortification, which is uncommon in such an accessible area.
The moat around the central fortification is intact, as are the north-west and north-east parts of the outermost moat, which originally connected to a moat surrounding the city itself. Centermost, the citadel sits on an island surrounded by its own moat.[1] 
North of the fort, between the second, third and fourth moat is Sweden's oldest allotment-garden. Several of its garden houses are attractions in themselves.[2] Also the fortress castle itself hides both history as such as well as historical horrors, like the 16th Century dungeon in the old western tower, into which the unlucky prisoners were thrown down through a hatch. If surviving the 4-5 meter fall, there then was neither any daylight or any way out. Also the eastern tower has in later centuries served as a prison for those serving life sentences.[3] Around 1900 until 1940 a part of the fortress served as a forced labour institution for vagrant women[4][5]

The anchorages for the cables, at 47 tons (104,000 lbs),[1] are noted as being the heaviest single pieces of steel ever to be galvanized.
