In 1323 two mills are mentioned in Leibstadt.  After the 1415 conquest of the Aargau, the two parts of the village (Oberleibstadt and Unterleibstadt, separated by a creek) were ruled separately by various overlords.  The former was part of the Austrian district of Laufenburg, while the latter was part of the Swiss Confederation's district of Leuggern in the County of Baden.  As a border village, Leibstadt was in danger any time the Habsburgs and the Confederation fought.

Until 1816 Oberleibstadt belonged to the municipality of Leuggern and then formed its own political municipality (until 1832 it included Full-Reuenthal) within the Zurzach district.  Unterleibstadt was an independent political municipality in the Laufenburg district.  In 1866 the two municipalities merged to form Leibstadt and became part of the Zurzach district.  The first school was founded in 1756 by the Knights order from Leuggern.[3]

The Abbey's prosperity was boosted though the passage of special privileges by both the English Kings and the Pope. These included an exemption from sending representatives to parliament and from paying tithe on certain land and livestock. Despite its privileges and sizeable landed estates, from the late 14th century the abbey began to suffer financially and was forced to lease out its estates. The worsening financial situation was exacerbated throughout the 15th century and early 16th century by a series of incompetent, corrupt and extravagant abbots. By 1535 the abbey's considerable income was exceeded by even more considerable debts.

Around 1363 the abbey suffered so much from flooding that a new site was chosen and it was rebuilt further inland for its patron, Robert de Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk (1298-1369). However there was a great fire in c. 1379 and further rebuilding was necessary.
