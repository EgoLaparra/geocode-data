The private line was built with 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) narrow gauge and was not connected to the national railway network. The line opened on 4 June 1896, and remained in use until 15 June 1953. It was built to carry lumber, but also featured a passenger service and other cargo transport. After 1908, the line was unprofitable and only had a limited service. Plans to connect it to the Sørland Line were proposed but rejected. The line had four stations and four halts, and was served with two 75 kilowatts (100 hp) steam locomotives, Lillesand and Flaksvand. The line was owned and operated by the private company, A/S Lillesand–Flaksvandbanen, although nearly all the shares were held by local municipalities, the county and the national government.

</p>
      <p id="GL322_108_002" num_links="3">The castle was built in the 13th century at a strategic site on the border of the bishoprics of Minden and Osnabrück, probably by the Bishop of Minden. Even before that, a castle or fortress was said to have stood on the site, at which Duke Widukind stayed. Around 1300, the castle became the possession of the counts of Ravensberg as a fief and was extended by them. The castle is first recorded in a document in 1319. On the death of the last Count of Ravensberg, Bernard in 1346, the Limberg, as part of the County of Ravensberg, fell to the later Duke of Jülich and Berg. In 1554, Limberg Castle was damaged by fire but restored. As a result of the War of the Jülich Succession, the castle was allocated in the 1614 Treaty of Xanten to the Elector of Brandenburg, who - after it had been captured and held during the Thirty Years' War by the Count Palatine of Neuburg, had it manned with a small contingent after 1647. During the war, it had been guarded by a 30-man garrison which was meant to guarantee the integrity of the castle, but when they were detailed to support the siege of <link wikipedia="Lippstadt" osm="30095912 152781" type="node relation">Lippstadt</link>, it was not difficult for the Count Palatine to seize it. In 1662, the castle's garrison of twenty men was transferred to the <link wikipedia="Sparrenberg_Castle" osm="19789175" type="way">Sparrenburg</link>, thus ending the its history as a military base. Regardless of its overlord, the castle was always in the charge of various vassal lords (Pfandherren) or bailiffs (Amtmänner or Droste). Towards the end of the 17th century, the castle gradually deteriorated and was barely usable for military purposes. In 1695, in a rescript by Elector Frederick I of Prussia to the Ravensberg bailiwick (Amtskammer), it was recommended that the house of Limberg be demolished since, due to its state of disrepair, it had become uninhabitable. In the text, it was said that Limberg House "which, due to its decrepitude, no one could live in, was to be demolished, it being not the least use to the people and the country, because it was not situated on any pass, but in times of war could only be used by the enemy as a thieve's den." The tower was still used as a <link wikipedia="Prison" osm="196399500 8710408" type="way relation">gaol</link> until 1805 and was finally sold in 1832. In the 1980s, an association was founded to preserve the castle ruins.

It was inaugurated 30 March 1933 in the presence of approximately 30,000 spectators and attended by Thorvald Stauning. It was a toll bridge until 1935.[1]  The first fixed link between the two cities was established in 1865 in the form of a pontoon bridge, which was in use until the present bridge was established; the original bridge was slow to open and close when ship traffic passed. The bridge was built, without any fatalities, between 1930-33 with 100-200 workers on the construction site. Large sections were built on Aalborg's waterfront west of the bridge's current location. A week before the inauguration, a load test occurred with 48 fully laden trucks placed on the bridge's leaf. A 1960 extension lane increased the bridge's width from 8.5 metres (28 ft) to 12.5 metres (41 ft). A bike path and walking area were added as well. The horizontal clearance measures 98 feet (30 m).[2] Route 180 crosses the bridge.[3]

Until 1948, the Costa Rican government did not recognize Afro-Caribbean people as citizens and restricted their movement outside Limón province.[4]  As a result of this "travel ban", this Afro-Caribbean population became firmly established in the region, which influenced decisions not to move even after it was legally permitted. Nowadays, there is a significant outflow of Limón natives who move to the country's Central Valley in search for better employment and education.[5]  The Afro-Caribbean community speaks Spanish and Limonese Creole, a creole of English.

When Venda was reincorporated into South Africa in 1994 the court continued to exist, and when the current Constitution of South Africa came into force it became one of the High Courts. It was known as the Venda Division until 2009, when it received the name of "Limpopo High Court, Thohoyandou". In 2013, in the restructuring brought about by the Superior Courts Act, the court at Thohoyandou became a local seat of the Limpopo Division, with the main seat to be established at Polokwane.[2]

Lin's forceful opposition to the opium trade was a primary catalyst for the First Opium War. He is praised for his constant position on the "moral high ground" in his fight, but he is also blamed for a rigid approach which failed to account for the domestic and international complexities of the problem.[2] The Daoguang Emperor endorsed the hardline policies advocated by Lin, but then blamed Lin for the resulting disastrous war.[3]

His father, Lin Binri (林賓日), served as an official under the Qing government. He was the second son in the family. As a child, he was already "unusually brilliant".[4] In 1811, he obtained the position of advanced Jinshi (進士) in the imperial examination, and in the same year he gained admission to the Hanlin Academy. He rose rapidly through various grades of provincial service. He opposed the opening of China but felt the need of a better knowledge of foreigners, which drove him to collect material for a geography of the world. He later gave this material to Wei Yuan, who published the Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms in 1843. He became Governor-General of <link wikipedia="Hunan" osm="244080670 913073" type="node relation">Hunan</link> and <link wikipedia="Hubei" osm="913106" type="relation">Hubei</link> in 1837, where he launched a suppression campaign against the trading of opium.[3]

However, White and Pusateri, in "Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks", Stanford University Press (1949) indicated that the volume of the Lincoln Tree based on measurements made in the 1930s is 51,000 cubic feet (1,400 m3), which would make the Lincoln Tree the second largest tree in the world, after the General Sherman Tree.[1] Wendell Flint was somewhat critical of the earlier measurements and he stated that he thought that it was appropriate to exclude a portion of the irregular base of the tree from his volume calculations, which in addition to some extrapolation differences from the earlier measurements, explains the smaller volume of 44,471 cubic feet (1,259.3 m3) that he obtained compared to the earlier figure.[2] Although he chose to exclude it, Flint stated that the excluded portion of the base could just as easily be included in the calculations, presumably leading to the alternative volume of 51,000 cubic feet (1,400 m3)[3] The Lincoln Tree has a maximum base diameter of 36.4 feet.[4] Nearby trees include the President Tree, the <link wikipedia="Washington_(tree)" osm="5566642129" type="node">Washington Tree</link>, the Adams Tree, and the Franklin Tree.

In 1916 the Demerara Bauxite Company Limited, known as DEMBA, a subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of Canada Limited, was established with the objective of mining, processing and selling bauxite.[2]
The site chosen for this preliminary venture was on the Demerara River, 105 kilometres (65 mi) south of the capital city <link wikipedia="Georgetown,_Guyana" osm="293789508" type="node">Georgetown</link>. At that time there was no settlement in the area, except for the wards of Wismar, Guyana Wismar and Christianburg. Mackenzie, the centre of the company's operations, takes its name from an American geologist of Scottish descent, George Bain Mackenzie, who first visited and explored the area for bauxite in 1913. He returned in 1914, bought lands for mining, and built several 45-ton wooden barges for use at the riverside near Three Friends Mine, which was the first mine to be worked.
