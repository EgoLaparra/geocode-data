Her one-woman crusade in the 1960s started after the highway in front of her motel was turned over to local control as a county road and removed from state highway maps when the nearby freeway opened.

The CDH system was created and expanded in scope c. October 5, 1970, after it was approved by the County Road Association of Michigan and the State Highway Commission.

For nearly two centuries from its settlement in 1688, New Rochelle was a quiet farming community with a bustling water dependent commercial center. Its proximity to the Sound had resulted in a booming resort trade by the late 1800s and wealthy Manhattanites flocked to the city's shores for recreation and relaxation. In 1889, The Town and Village of New Rochelle were incorporated as one city with a population of 14,000 residents. Just three decades later, New Rochelle's population had grown to over 54,000, having become one of the most sought after suburban communities in the country. The community's expansion of infrastructure and neighborhoods kept pace with the mushrooming population. These early suburban neighborhoods were extremely popular with commuters, a new segment of American society choosing to live outside of the urban center and travel in daily for work. Developers immediately set to the task of providing them with fine homes and desirable communities on the waiting large tracts of farmland. Beginning with the southern tier of town, planned residential communities spread across the City, ultimately earning it the nickname "City of Homes".

Little Africa was one of a number of independent African American communities formed across the South after the Civil War. Founded c.1880 by former slave Simpson Foster and
a Cherokee Indian, Emanuel Waddell, it was originally 500 acres set aside for their relatives. The early residents were descendants of Simpson Foster and Emanuel Waddell who maintained the tradition of farming and agricultural life in Little Africa for decades. By 1910, family community leaders had built the two-room Africa School to teach
local children. One of S.C.’s first Rosenwald Fund schools later opened there. Near the school, family community members built Fairview C.M.E. c.1912, one mile from Highway 9. Congregants first organized themselves c.1902 at the home Emanuel Waddell. During Jim Crow and after Brown v Board of Education, New residents as other families settled nearby 
seeking economic opportunity and refuge from white supremacy. Some of Simpson Foster and Emauael Waddell's families still reside in Little Africa, after some five generations since the end of Slavery in 1865.

Up the hill to the east is Chesterford Park, with a mid-19th-century mansion in a 250-acre (approx. 100 hectare) estate and now a science park called Chesterford Research Park. The wide and relatively deep valley of the river Cam provides a rolling landscape of chalky boulder clay with extensive and wide views. The surrounding farmland is mostly in intensive arable use and except for areas alongside the river, some of which is liable to flooding, is classified as being of grade 2 quality.[2]

      <p id="GL325_464_002" num_links="2">Mt. Monadnock has long been cited as one of the most frequently climbed mountains in the world.[4] Monadnock's bare, isolated, and rocky summit provides expansive views. It bears a number of hiking trails, including the 110-mile (180 km) <link wikipedia="Metacomet-Monadnock_Trail" osm="2317544" type="relation">Metacomet-Monadnock Trail</link> and the 50-mile (80 km) <link wikipedia="Monadnock-Sunapee_Greenway" osm="3888871" type="relation">Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway</link>.[3] The summit is barren largely because of fires set by early settlers. The first major fire, set in 1800 to clear the lower slopes for pasture, swept through the stands of virgin red spruce on the summit and flanks of the mountain. Between 1810 and 1820, local farmers, who believed that wolves were denning in the blowdowns, set fire to the mountain again. The conflagration raged for weeks, destroying the topsoil and denuding the mountain above 2,000 feet (610 m).[5]
