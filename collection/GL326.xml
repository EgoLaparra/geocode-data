During the Mesolithic era, the fenland basin was mostly dry and forested, although subject to salt and fresh water incursions. The marshes and meres of this fenland may therefore have been difficult to occupy, other than seasonally, but there is evidence of human settlement on the island since the late Neolithic Age; a Bronze Age causeway linked the village with the nearby Barway, to the south-east. An investigation, prior to a 1995 development in the village, discovered a farm and large tile-kiln of Romano-British origin; further investigations uncovered an earlier settlement of the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The Roman road Akeman Street passed through the north-west corner of the parish, and the lost 7th century Anglo-Saxon village of Cratendune may be nearby.[2][3]

The river is approximately 400 kilometres (250 mi) long and drains an area of about 22,000 square kilometres (8,500 sq mi).

The <link wikipedia="Zagros_Mountains" osm="5130853663" type="node">Zagros Mountains</link> have been occupied since at least the Lower Palaeolithic, but the earliest archaeological site in the Little Zab basin, Barda Balka, dates to the Middle Palaeolithic.

Thus, the river flows through valleys that are predominantly aligned along a northwest–southeast axis, parallel to the major mountain chains of the Zagros, only to change its direction abruptly where it cuts through these chains in narrow gorges.[3] The Little Zab enters the plain south of Dukan, where it first assumes a roughly westward course before turning to the southwest upstream from the town of Altun Kopru and uniting with the Tigris near the town of <link wikipedia="Al_Zab" osm="2489253196" type="node">Al Zab</link>.[4] Most tributaries join the Little Zab upstream from Dukan, with the largest being the Baneh River and the Qala Chulan.[3] A number of smaller streams joined the Little Zab in the <link wikipedia="Ranya" osm="598459803" type="node">Ranya</link> Plain, which is now partly inundated by Lake Dukan.[5]

      <p id="GL326_360_002" num_links="2">Liw probably started as a gord guarding the ford across Liwiec river and the eastern borders of Duchy of Masovia, and the stronghold was moved from the original site to the area of the present castle, built in 1429, in the 13th century.  First written document about Liw comes from 1304, during Masovian duke Bolesław II of Masovia rule.
Liw received town rights in 1421 or earlier, and between 1493 and 1789 there were two separate towns, Liw Stary ("Old Liw") and Liw Nowy ("New Liw"), and this tradition survived in two Sołtys(Schultheiß) offices in the present village. 
Under the Masovian dukes the town was developing rapidly lying on the border with Grand Duchy of Lithuania, it became the capital of ziemia liwska ('Land of Liw'), a judicial center for the eastern Masovia region, it held a weekly Street market, and three times a year there was a fair there. It was finally incorporated into Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1537, upon the settlement between the last princes of Masovia Anna of Masovia and Polish king <link wikipedia="Sigismund_I_the_Old" osm="2519674" type="relation">Sigismund I the Old</link>. Town continued its development and growth into the 17th century, when the wars, Deluge (history) and Great Northern War, brought a physical destruction and a serious decline to the municipality. It lost some of its importance to Węgrów but its final demise was brought by the Partitions of Poland as it was incorporated into the Austrian Partition, the Liw lost its judicial, administrative and economic importance, Austrians dissolved the administrative and territorial unit of ziemia liwska and  moved the seat of administrative and judicial powers to <link wikipedia="Siedlce" osm="1854937117 1386747 2910908 2924176 6105779" type="node relation relation relation relation">Siedlce</link>.
