The reason for the unique situation of Llandudno Lifeboat goes back to 1861 when the boathouse was positioned so that it could be towed equally quickly to either of Llandudno's main shores. The boathouse was constructed in 1903.[2]In order to accommodate the new Shannon-class lifeboat, a new boathouse was built on the south end of the promenade at Craig-y-Don. The new lifeboat "William F. Yates" (ON1325) arrived at its new home on 24 September 2017.

According to the 19th-century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd, the first church in <link wikipedia="Llanynghenedl" osm="254041282" type="node">Llanynghenedl</link> was erected in about 620. A new church was erected in 1862, replacing a building that the 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones noted as dating in part from the late 13th or early 14th century, based on the decorations on the south doorway. The church later fell into disuse as a result of the growth of the nearby village of Valley and the church there.  In 1988, St Enghenedl's was dismantled and re-erected as an extension to St Mihangel's, Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn, so that St Mihangel's could serve as the church for <link wikipedia="RAF_Valley" osm="367105666" type="way">RAF Valley</link>.
