According to the ASI, Lothal had the world's earliest known dock, which connected the city to an ancient course of the <link wikipedia="Sabarmati_River" osm="164775725" type="way">Sabarmati</link> river on the trade route between <link wikipedia="Harappa" osm="2960170283" type="node">Harappan</link> cities in <link wikipedia="Sindh" osm="316441014 357981" type="node relation">Sindh</link> and the peninsula of Saurashtra when the surrounding <link wikipedia="Kutch_district" osm="316417062 8269590" type="node relation">Kutch</link> desert of today was a part of the <link wikipedia="Arabian_Sea" osm="9328393" type="relation">Arabian Sea</link>.

It is the centre of the Makhado Local Municipality, which comprises 16,000 km² with a total population of 270,000 (2001). Louis Trichardt is located in a fertile region where litchis, bananas, mangoes and nuts are produced. The national road N1 runs through the town. Louis Trichardt is 437 kilometres from Johannesburg and one hour's drive from the Zimbabwean border at Beitbridge. Louis Trichardt was formerly known as Makhado, but it was changed back to Louis Trichardt.[2] But now many people use the one name or the other.[citation needed] Vleifontein, Elim, Tshikota, Madombidzha, Makhado Park and Dzanani surround the town at all directions.
