Upper Burrell Township is still somewhat rural, though it has experienced some suburban growth in recent years due to many employment opportunities nearby. In 1959, in the midst of the growth of their community, township residents voted to make Lower Burrell a third class city. Lower Burrell continued to grow substantially until the 1980s. Like many communities in Western Pennsylvania, Lower Burrell suffered economic and population stagnation with the collapse of local heavy industry. Since the early 1990s, Lower Burrell experienced slight growth, though one of its only large shopping centers remains mostly vacant. Preliminary data from the 2010 census shows that Lower Burrell has lost about 5 percent of its population since 2000.

Between 1908 and 1984, the glacier experienced a loss of thickness by 45 meters (147 ft). Between 1984 and 2002, the glacier lost another 6 meters (19 ft) in thickness. Lower Curtis Glacier also lost 28% of its surface area between the end of the little ice age (around 1850) and 1950. Between the years 1951 and 1979, the glacier actually lengthened by 245 meters (800 ft) but has retreated 184 m (600 ft) since 1985, partly due to the tongue of the glacier being on a steep precipice which may have increased the loss of ice at the termini.[4]

It picks up two tributaries from the south, then one from the northeast, then one each from the south and north. The creek's valley gets wider as it flows out of Washington Township and into Pine Grove Township. As it enters the township, it flows between Swope Mountain to the south and Swatara Hill to the north. The creek passes by the communities of Marstown and Crowtown, as well as a sewage disposal station. At this point, the creek empties into Swatara Creek.[4][3]

Lower Salem was once home to a hotel, a doctor's office, an armory, Wagner's General Store, and a gas station and auto parts shop. While all of these buildings remain standing, all have gone out of business. The general store (affectionately known as the "Ron Paul Building" for its prominent and prolonged display of Paul's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaign posters) has been home to a number of startup businesses, but none have survived much longer than a year.

Czech immigrants were the most prominent and named the district after Plzeň, the fourth largest city in what is now the <link wikipedia="Czech_Republic" osm="424313803 51684" type="node relation">Czech Republic</link>. They replaced the Germans and Irish who had settled there before them, in the mid-nineteenth century. These German and Irish residents lived in poor conditions throughout the 1850s and ‘60s. The Pilsen area was overcrowded and suffered from flooding, lack of indoor plumbing, and illness. A cholera outbreak that killed hundreds, eventually led the German and Irish residents to move in search of better living conditions.[2] The population also included smaller numbers of other ethnic groups from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, such as Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats and Austrians, as well as immigrants of Polish and <link wikipedia="Lithuania" osm="424297773 72596" type="node relation">Lithuanian</link> heritage. Many of the immigrants worked in the stockyards and surrounding factories. Like many early 20th century American urban neighborhoods, however, Pilsen was home to both wealthy professionals and the working class, with the whole area knitted together based on the ethnicities, mostly of Slavic descent, who were not readily welcome in other areas of the city.[3]

It has wide, sandy beaches, two piers and other attractions. While its fisheries have declined, oil and gas exploitation in the southern North Sea in the 1960s added to its development, as a base for the industry alongside nearby Great Yarmouth. This role has declined, but the town has begun to develop as an Eastern England centre of the renewable energy industry.

The mill was marked on maps dated 1762, 1777, 1789, 1823 and the early Ordnance Survey maps.

The present bridge replaces an older bridge, which is thought to have been constructed with timber decking between stone piers.[1]  There is evidence that the river was forded here before a bridge was built.[2]  The date of the building of the present bridge is unknown; it is considered to have been after 1591, when the previous bridge was described as being "in a dangerous condition".[1][2][3]  A date of 1684 has been suggested, but petitions regarding the bridge put before the Quarter Sessions between 1650 and 1750 make no mention of a new bridge between these dates.[1]  The bridge was paid for by the County of Lancashire, and later the responsibility for maintenance and repairs was transferred to the Lonsdale Hundred.[1]
