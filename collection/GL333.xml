The water flowing in from Araz enriches the lake with chlorides and has high mineralization. It is argued that throughout the ages, the rivers have flooded the area creating depressions and then refilled them with water. Before the 20th century, Ağgöl was already partially fed by drainage waters from irrigated fields. The volume of water in the lake had fluctuated in the past when it faced being dried out in single years and when it reached very high volumes of water in other years. When the <link wikipedia="Mingachevir" osm="227052744 3812581" type="node relation">Mingachevir</link> dam was built in the mid 20th century, the water regime in the Mil steppe and Kura-Araz lowland changed. From 1960, the water to the lake inflowed only from saline water collectors built in the region to drain irrigation waters. In the present, the lake is fed by "K-2" and "K-3" collectors. Some areas around the lake have been used as pasture grounds. Other areas were transformed into irrigated agricultural lands used to grow cotton, wheat, lucerne, vegetables and wine.[3]

The lake was originally known as "Grass Lake" and once lay in the center of a marsh surrounded by pastureland as well as apple and cherry orchards. Grass Lake was one of the so-called "triplet lakes" lying along M-44. Its sister lakes to the east are Silver Lake and Bostwick Lake. Developed by the Velting family contractors in the mid-1970s, Grass Lake was expanded and a large dike was added to the western edge to raise the water level. Residential and commercial development was soon constructed and in the early 21st century, a lakeside suburban sub-division also called "Lake Bella Vista" functions very much as a community. Lake Bella Vista is bordered by M-44, (Belding Road) on the south, 9 Mile Road on the North, Blakely Road on the West, and Myers Lake Avenue on the East. To the south are the Lockhart family orchards and the beginning of the Stout Creek watershed which cuts through forest-concealed glacial dunes bordering the Woodbrook area.[citation needed]

It is notable for its relatively great depth for the region - 50 metres (160 ft) - created as a deep gouge in the landscape in the most recent glaciation.[1]  The lake is located in the Meshchyera Lowlands, a glacial alluvial plain of swampy lowlands, gravelly moraines and limestone bedrock.[2] It was once connected by an artificial canal to Lake Velikoye ("Grand Lake", a much larger lake with a surface area of 20 square kilometres (7.7 sq mi)).  The canal was filled in 2009.   Lake Beloye is surrounded by pine forests, with reeds and sedge predominating on the shore.  It is a popular lake for recreation and fishing, being home to pike, carp and other fish.

When school officials realized a school without walls was distracting to teenage students, temporary walls were installed around many classrooms in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This resulted in significant climate control problems throughout the building, most of which were left unfixed until the school was renovated.[citation needed]

The standpipe was a popular form of water tower from about 1860 to the turn of the 20th-century.[2] The city council first attempted to build it as early as 1890, but the $10,000 bond was rejected.  An $8,000 bond issue passed in June 1893, and a Water Works Department was established.  The city contracted with the A.F. Paige Company of <link wikipedia="Sioux_City,_Iowa" osm="151408655 1910970545" type="node node">Sioux City</link> to build the tower, which is 90 feet (27 m) tall and a diameter of 12 feet (4 m).[2]  It was completed in November 1893.  Water mains were laid the following year and water was delivered to most citizens of Lake City.  It also allowed the city to provide adequate fire protection.  A new water tank was built next to the standpipe in the 1920s.  It has subsequently been replaced by a larger structure on the southeast side of town.  The standpipe was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.[1]

It was created in 1939 when the North Fork Dam, a 155-foot (47 m) tall variable radius arch dam, was completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, for the purpose of containing gold-mining debris which were washing downriver. This resulting reservoir is a long and narrow lake approximately 3.5 miles long and 300 feet wide in some areas.[1] The lake and surrounding area is owned by the United States Bureau of Reclamation and managed by California Department of Parks and Recreation.

      <p id="GL333_212_002" num_links="2">The reservoir is open to boat traffic, a water-skiing and wakeboarding spot during the summer. However, it is possible to quietly enjoy the lake for kayaking, rowing, and fishing. It features steep forested canyon walls and contains several large high quality limestone deposits, one large vertical outcropping of which is known as Robbers Roost, and offers climbing and caving opportunities for the adventurous. A popular hiking, running, and mountain biking trail courses from the dam area, continues downstream below the 730 ft (223 m) in height Foresthill Bridge, linking Lake Clementine to the North and Middle Forks American River Confluence area below the dam. The trail also connects to a large network of hiking, running, and mountain biking trail systems stretching eastward into the <link wikipedia="Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" osm="5121783821" type="node">Sierra Nevada</link> mountain range, near <link wikipedia="Lake_Tahoe" osm="1823287" type="relation">Lake Tahoe</link>.

      <p id="GL333_258_001" num_links="2">Lake Crystal was founded by William Riley Robinson and Lucius O. Hunt of New York, who arrived in July 1854.[9] Robinson and Hunt named the three nearby lakes, Loon, Crystal, and Lily Lakes. Mr. Robinson and his family settled in a log cabin on the south shore of Crystal Lake, a few feet south of where the Robinson House is today. While Mr. Hunt and his family settled in a log cabin on the south shore of Lily Lake, now where the Holy Family Catholic Church is. Each men took plots of land one mile long and half a mile long (the dividing line being modern day Main Street), the deeds of which properties were signed by President <link wikipedia="James_Buchanan" osm="2512120" type="relation">James Buchanan</link>. The local Natives were great beggars who kept tabs on the newcomers. The Sioux even continued to hold their tribal dances in the Grove on Crystal Lake, which is now Robinson Park. One day, Mrs. Robinson was trying to put her baby to sleep, however a Native Chief ‘Standing Buffalo’ (Tatanka-Najin) and his friends were making several loud yelps. Mrs. Robinson then grabbed a whip after the Natives made a frightening yelp, and almost struck ‘Standing Buffalo’. However he gave her a wicked look, and calmly walked away. If Mrs. Robinson had hit him, the settlement would most likely have been massacred. In August 1862, Mr. Robinson was awakened early one morning by a knock at his door, it was an old Native American friend of his and several others in war paint. The Natives told Mr. Robinson and his family to leave the settlement, as the people there and of the surrounding territory were to be massacred. The Natives also warned to not tell anyone, especially Mr. Hunt, as Robinson's Native friend wanted to scalp him personally. Robinson noticed there was an absence of Natives in the area and snuck into a nearby camp. Robinson learned that everything his Native friend had said was true, and began to warn the settlement, who all escaped to the fort at <link wikipedia="Mankato,_Minnesota" osm="151366161 137644" type="node relation">Mankato</link>. Natives discovered the settlement empty, and in a rage, burned the settlement. Eventually the Native uprising was subdued and the settlers returned and rebuilt their homes. Mr. Hunt would build a brick house in 1869 that would be torn down in the mid-1900's, which is now where the Holy Family Catholic Church is today. Robinson built his brick house in 1870, which is still standing as a historical building at 301 east Robinson Street.[10]

The path was built in 1982.[5] It is surrounded by a park and townhouses. The lake, which was built in 1974, is named for the Elkhorn branch of the <link wikipedia="Patuxent_River" osm="1347686 1357743" type="relation relation">Little Patuxent River</link>.

The lake is overseen by the Columbia Association. The lake's location behind many townhouses, though considered an attractive feature to homeowners, has raised concern following the drowning of a small child on September 2, 2005. A drowning occurred in 1980 and a maintenance worker drowned in March 1991.[10][11] A movement was started soon after to erect a fence around playground next to the lake, but the community was split over this need, and a consultant concluded a fence was not necessary.[12][13][14] The lake remained free of incidents until the 8 October 2013 when a body of a 32-year-old was found dead in the lake.[15]

The lake, originally called George's Lake was later changed to Lake George when the post office opened. The lake itself freezes mostly solid in the wintertime, which made it ideal for railroad men to cut large blocks of ice from it in order to keep perishables cool. A privately owned ice company here supplied the needs of much of the Pikes Peak region. Ice cut during the winter was shipped on the CM to both Colorado Springs and the <link wikipedia="Cripple_Creek,_Colorado" osm="112377" type="relation">Cripple Creek, Colorado</link> district.[8] Also related to the town's railroading history, a short walk into the surrounding hills reveals Chinese bread ovens, from the period their labor was imported.  At the turn of the century the community's population was 30.[8] After 1900 some farmers and ranchers nearby began raising high-altitude potatoes on a limited scale.  This furnished the CM with some additional traffic.[8] However, the CM closed in August 1918.  Other railways then provided service to certain shippers along the otherwise idle CM railway.[9]  Up to that time this had been the shortest rail route through the mountains.  Keeping the track open during winter proved expensive, and when the mining of ore dwindled, the tracks were torn up.  <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_24_in_Colorado" osm="121136" type="relation">U.S. Highway 24</link> follows the abandoned grade of the CM railway.[10] By 1941 the community had grown to 100 persons and was the center of an extensive potato growing area.[10] The community's population in 1965 was 100.[8]
