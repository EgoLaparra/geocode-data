Natural landslide dams are usually short-lived, but some have been known to fail after long periods—131 years in the case of Lake Yashinkul in the former Soviet Union.  This prompted the United States Geological Survey to investigate the possibility that the Lake San Cristobal dam might fail.  Based on its non-porous composition and the fact that part of the dam's natural spillway is actually cut into bedrock and not the material deposited by the landslide, the USGS concluded the dam is stable. Sediments washing down via the Lake Fork and Slumgullion Creek are slowly filling in the lake, but are not expected to affect the dam's stability. If sedimentation continues at the past rate, the lake will have completely filled with sediment in about 2,500 years.[2]

Flights with turboprop and prop aircraft continued with Pacific Air Lines resuming Fairchild F-27 turboprop service.  Pacific Air Lines successors Air West and Hughes Airwest served the airport with the F-27 until the early 1970s.

However, in the year 2000, the lake still had an acidity of 5.14 at the 200 meter depth, and 4.91 at the 400 meter depth, indicating that full recovery has not yet been achieved.

Founded in 1869, the cemetery was favored by wealthy families during the Gilded Age, and today the cemetery is known for its numerous lavish funerary monuments and mausoleums. The extensive early monument building at Lake View helped give rise to the Little Italy neighborhood, but over-expansion nearly bankrupted the burial ground in 1888. Financial recovery only began in 1893, and took several years. Lake View grew and modernized significantly from 1896 to 1915 under the leadership of president Henry R. Hatch. The cemetery's cautious management allowed it to avoid retrenchment and financial problems during the Great Depression.

The Europeans built naval stores and the discovery of turpentine oil led to the Wilmington-Manchester railroad track being created. A shingle company was later converted to a lumber company.[5]  In 1910, a group of townspeople created the Waccamaw Club.[6]

Now with a new water treatment facility rated for up to 15 million gallons per day, Lake Whitney has been reconnected as a reserve water source for the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority. This act has caused a lot of controversy in the area[citation needed] mainly because of residents' concerns about the water flow over the waterfall into the Mill River. Because of this, the regional water authority has agreed to extract only enough water to satisfy the need and change these levels depending upon the season. They also agreed to install a pump to ensure the flow of water over the dam at all times and are currently building a fish ladder to allow fish to swim upriver.

This conclusion contrasts with work done by Peter deMenocal of <link wikipedia="Columbia_University" osm="169626373 8391533" type="way relation">Columbia University</link> and colleagues, who in 2000 drilled a core of ocean sediment off the western coast of <link wikipedia="Mauritania" osm="424316493 192763" type="node relation">Mauritania</link>.

It was officially classified as an area "Ramsar", which involves protection of this location. Several studies have been conducted on water and soil of the region Fetzara [1-7]. These studies were carried out to monitor the salinity and to highlight its origins and factors governing it. The main objective of this study was to evaluate soil properties of Fetzara Lake that are affected by the phenomenon of salinization and to study their variation with depth. The samples were taken on the first two layers (0–20 cm and 20–40 cm) at eight points around the Fetzara Lake, for a total of 16 samples. The analytical results indicate that soil salinity has reached its maximum in the northeast (region of Wadi Zied) and south of Lake (region of Cheurfa) with a dominance of sodium chloride-chemical facies.

      <p id="GL335_419_002" num_links="4">Lakeland is unique among all Amtrak stations in that it has two separate Amtrak station codes; one for passengers traveling to and from points north and the other for passengers traveling to and from points south. Since 2004, when the Silver Star initially arrives in Lakeland from either <link wikipedia="Pennsylvania_Station_(New_York_City)" osm="895371274" type="node">New York</link> or Miami, it heads west to <link wikipedia="Tampa_Union_Station" osm="25630401" type="way">Tampa</link>, then returns to Lakeland over the same route. After its second stop in Lakeland, the train continues on a bit further east along its previous route and then finally turns north toward New York or south toward Miami. Passengers disembarking at Lakeland station do so before the train heads to Tampa and passengers boarding at Lakeland only do so after the train returns from Tampa.[Note 1] This logical arrangement allows passengers boarding or debarking at the Lakeland station to avoid having to make an unnecessary trip to Tampa before continuing on their way. (Excluding Tampa, the next southbound stop on the Silver Star is in <link wikipedia="Winter_Haven,_Florida" osm="154128007 119048" type="node relation">Winter Haven</link> and the next northbound station is in <link wikipedia="Kissimmee,_Florida" osm="4226093232 117709" type="node relation">Kissimmee</link>.)
