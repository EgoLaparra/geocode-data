It was an important centre of the flax and linen industries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Landerneau is also the hometown of Édouard Leclerc, a businessman and entrepreneur who founded the French supermarket chain E.Leclerc in 1948. His first store applies a hard competition with other supermarket chains with local made products and lower prices. Leclerc's new methods of sales are still applied in all supermarkets and hypermarkets and marks an evolution in the market's history. The town is actually the heart of the agricultural market in northwest Brittany with several agribusiness companies headquarters located in the town.

Duke Albrecht, inspired by his wife Marie Elisabeth established a theatre hall in the Zeughaus [de] (armoury) building. In 1764, Duke Ernst Friedrich established another theatre, in the former Ballhaus (today the location of the Arkaden [de]), but no continuous stage work ensued. Only in 1827, when Duke Ernst I founded the Herzoglich-Sächsisches Hoftheater (ducal Saxon court theatre) was a permanent theatrical ensemble hired. The location was still the Ballhaus which soon turned out to be insufficient.

The moat around the central fortification is intact, as are the north-west and north-east parts of the outermost moat, which originally connected to a moat surrounding the city itself. Centermost, the citadel sits on an island surrounded by its own moat.[1] 
North of the fort, between the second, third and fourth moat is Sweden's oldest allotment-garden. Several of its garden houses are attractions in themselves.[2] Also the fortress castle itself hides both history as such as well as historical horrors, like the 16th Century dungeon in the old western tower, into which the unlucky prisoners were thrown down through a hatch. If surviving the 4-5 meter fall, there then was neither any daylight or any way out. Also the eastern tower has in later centuries served as a prison for those serving life sentences.[3] Around 1900 until 1940 a part of the fortress served as a forced labour institution for vagrant women[4][5]

The bridge is 113 meters (371 feet) in length, carrying six 3.5 meters (11 feet) wide lanes for vehicle traffic, as well as two 3.5 meter sidewalks. The cable stayed design was chosen for aesthetic reasons, as well as having a smaller potential for environmental degradation on the river environment. The anchorages for the cables, at 47 tons (104,000 lbs),[1] are noted as being the heaviest single pieces of steel ever to be galvanized. Total price for the project was US$15.6 million with the following funding sources:

      <p id="GL337_497_002" num_links="2">Construction of the reservoir began in 1898, the logistics of getting the workforce and materials to Langsett caused great difficulty as most of them came up from Sheffield. This involved a journey over four different stretches of railway line, the first leg was from <link wikipedia="Sheffield_station" osm="4290859478" type="node">Sheffield Midland Station</link> to <link wikipedia="Deepcar" osm="247488459" type="node">Deepcar</link>, this was followed by a journey to Stocksbridge on the Samuel Fox and Company private line. From the Samuel Fox steelworks a new one mile long line was built to reach the Underbank Reservoir to join up with the Water Authority track up to Langsett Reservoir.[1]
