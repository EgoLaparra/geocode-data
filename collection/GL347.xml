Most of the current structures originally were built in Renaissance and Baroque styles between the 16th and 18th centuries. After Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden conquered the area in 1631 during the Thirty Years' War, the castle was reconstructed as a Baroque residence. After it ceased to serve as residence of the Bishops of Würzburg, the fortress saw repeated action in the wars of the late 18th and 19th centuries. Festung Marienberg was severely damaged by British bombs in March 1945 and only fully rebuilt in 1990. Today, it houses two museums.

The building housing the museum was built by the famous Greek theater actress Marika Kotopouli (1887–1954) as her holiday home in 1926. During the Second World War, the house was requisitioned by the Germans and after the war it housed the local Police Station. The Zographou Municipality with support of the Association of Greek Actors restored the building with its distinctive architecture and beautiful interiors. In 1990, it opened to the public as a museum of modern art. It hosts various interim art exhibitions as well as the permanent collection of Konstantinos Ioannides.

The Arab geographer El Idrisi writes that during the Arab domination (827-1091) it was called Marsa A'Rillah (small port) and during the years 1584 and 1596 a watchtower known as Torre Cabrera was built by order of the Count B. Cabrera next to the port of the village due to Saracen-ships sailing this stretch of sea. It remained a sleepy fishing village until the 1870s when its port was extensively used for the export of the local asphalt, mined in Ragusa, to numerous European capitals. It was called Mazzarelli until 1928 when the local council changed the name in Marina di Ragusa. During the 1960s, it became a tourist resort, a role which it still maintains today.

Diodorus places it 22 years earlier, or 650 BCE, and Hieronymus still further back in 654 BCE. The date from Thucydides, which is probably the most likely, is incompatible with this earlier date.[3] The name is supposed to have been derived from quantities of wild celery (Ancient Greek: σέλινον, romanized: (selinon))[4] that grew on the spot. For the same reason, they adopted the celery leaf as the symbol on their coins.

While escaping from Kiev after the Germans attacked it, she collected valuable information and gave it to the 5th Airborne Brigade of the 3rd Airborne Corps, commanded by Alexander Rodimtsev, which allowed the Soviets to defeat some of the German troops; this earned her a position in the service. On August 13 1941, she was wounded in a battle south of Kiev and, despite being wounded, she continued and saved her commander from German captivity. Later, she captured a high-ranking German officer and, with this deed, started attracting the attention of Rodimtsev, who closely followed her achievements. However, Borovichenko herself was captured near the village  of Kazaktskoye but she soon escaped and notified her team. On September 5 1941, after the Germans were surrounding Kiev, Rodimtsev moved his troops to the <link wikipedia="Seym_River" osm="1745111" type="relation">Seym River</link> near <link wikipedia="Konotop" osm="337510526" type="node">Konotop</link>, but the Germans followed and attempted to coax them across a damaged railroad bridge. However, Borovichenko saw this coming and convinced her comrades to help set up a Maxim gun and, as a spotter and loader, she cleared the way for the troops; Rodimtsev personally congratulated her. On September 17, she single-handedly captured ten German soldiers while scouting. She was prominently featured in newspapers as she carried on at the battlefront. At the Battle of Stalingrad, her fiancé was hit by a bullet.[3][4]
