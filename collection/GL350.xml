In the past the island was used by locals for the collection of seaweed for use as a fertiliser, but today Lihou is mainly used for tourism, including school trips. Lihou is also an important centre for conservation, forming part of a Ramsar wetland site for the preservation of rare birds and plants as well as historic ruins of a priory and a farmhouse.

The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3 or Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. For stylistic reasons, the inscription has been attributed to the runemaster Visäte, who was active during the last half of the 11th century in southern Uppland.[1] Eight surviving runestones that are signed by Visäte include U 74 in Husby, U 208 in Råcksta, U 236 in Lindö, <link wikipedia="Granby_Runestone" osm="5094765075" type="node">U 337</link> in Granby, U 454 in Kumla, U 669 in Kålsta, U 862 in Säva, and <link wikipedia="Uppland_Runic_Inscription_Fv1946;258" osm="972550791" type="node">U Fv1946;258</link> in Fällbro, and over twenty others have been attributed to this runemaster based on stylistic analysis.

The move could be explained by the fact that in 1149, three-fourths of Bornholm had been surrendered to Eskil, archbishop of Lund. As a result, King Sweyn III wanted to establish his own seat of power on the remaining fourth of the island.[3] While it could not be compared to the archbishop's <link wikipedia="Hammershus" osm="378890205" type="way">Hammershus</link>, Lilleborg was nevertheless a fine stronghold and appears to have been easier to defend than the much larger Gamleborg. There is evidence suggesting the fortress burnt down in 1259 when Prince Jaromar of Rügen stormed and destroyed the "king's stronghold" on Bornholm. However, coins minted after that date have been found, indicating it was inhabited after its storming.[1][4]

The private line was built with 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) narrow gauge and was not connected to the national railway network. The line opened on 4 June 1896, and remained in use until 15 June 1953. It was built to carry lumber, but also featured a passenger service and other cargo transport. After 1908, the line was unprofitable and only had a limited service. Plans to connect it to the <link wikipedia="Sørlandet_Line" osm="1837965" type="relation">Sørland Line</link> were proposed but rejected. The line had four stations and four halts, and was served with two 75 kilowatts (100 hp) steam locomotives, Lillesand and Flaksvand. The line was owned and operated by the private company, A/S Lillesand–Flaksvandbanen, although nearly all the shares were held by local municipalities, the county and the national government.

      <p id="GL350_226_002" num_links="3">The castle was built in the 13th century at a strategic site on the border of the bishoprics of Minden and Osnabrück, probably by the Bishop of Minden. Even before that, a castle or fortress was said to have stood on the site, at which Duke Widukind stayed. Around 1300, the castle became the possession of the counts of Ravensberg as a fief and was extended by them. The castle is first recorded in a document in 1319. On the death of the last Count of Ravensberg, Bernard in 1346, the Limberg, as part of the County of Ravensberg, fell to the later Duke of Jülich and Berg. In 1554, Limberg Castle was damaged by fire but restored. As a result of the War of the Jülich Succession, the castle was allocated in the 1614 Treaty of Xanten to the Elector of Brandenburg, who - after it had been captured and held during the Thirty Years' War by the Count Palatine of Neuburg, had it manned with a small contingent after 1647. During the war, it had been guarded by a 30-man garrison which was meant to guarantee the integrity of the castle, but when they were detailed to support the siege of <link wikipedia="Lippstadt" osm="30095912 152781" type="node relation">Lippstadt</link>, it was not difficult for the Count Palatine to seize it. In 1662, the castle's garrison of twenty men was transferred to the <link wikipedia="Sparrenberg_Castle" osm="19789175" type="way">Sparrenburg</link>, thus ending its history as a military base. Regardless of its overlord, the castle was always in the charge of various vassal lords (Pfandherren) or bailiffs (Amtmänner or Droste). Towards the end of the 17th century, the castle gradually deteriorated and was barely usable for military purposes. In 1695, in a rescript by Elector Frederick I of Prussia to the Ravensberg bailiwick (Amtskammer), it was recommended that the house of Limberg be demolished since, due to its state of disrepair, it had become uninhabitable. In the text, it was said that Limberg House "which, due to its decrepitude, no one could live in, was to be demolished, it being not the least use to the people and the country, because it was not situated on any pass, but in times of war could only be used by the enemy as a thieve's den." The tower was still used as a <link wikipedia="Prison" osm="196399500 8710408" type="way relation">gaol</link> until 1805 and was finally sold in 1832. In the 1980s, an association was founded to preserve the castle ruins.

Historically this location at the meeting of the two major local rivers gave Limeuil immense importance – both commercially and strategically. In medieval times, the rivers were the highways of trade, and to be at the convergence of two of them was a unique advantage in the region: this was, historically, primarily a wine-producing area, much of the wine quite 'rough', but the casks of relatively better wine were delivered into the 'chais' at Limeuil, for subsequent delivery downstream to Bordeaux, on large, flat-bottomed 'gabarres' [See 'the wine trade', below]. The rivermen had to be accommodated here, and to this day the riverside bar/restaurant bears the name L'ancre de Salut – a boatsman's term meaning literally 'the safety anchor', a place where the rivermen could find food, wine, a bed, and rest, before their return up river. The church at the top of the village [there are two churches – see 'Churches' below] is, significantly, named after Ste Catherine, who was the patron saint of boat people. Strategically, Limeuil consequently had to defend itself (and its inhabitants) from the relentless waves of territory-grabbing that arose from the Hundred Years' War, and the Wars of Religion – endless 'chevauchées' [see 'Medieval Wars' below] that would see the locality relentlessly under attack, for over two hundred years (the so-called Hundred Years' War lasted, in fact, for 116 years!) The hillside promontory on which the village is situated provides a natural defence – and was surmounted by a chateau, enclosed within its defensive circular stone walls [see 'The Chateau'] below.

It was a toll bridge until 1935.[1]  The first fixed link between the two cities was established in 1865 in the form of a pontoon bridge, which was in use until the present bridge was established; the original bridge was slow to open and close when ship traffic passed. The bridge was built, without any fatalities, between 1930-33 with 100-200 workers on the construction site. Large sections were built on Aalborg's waterfront west of the bridge's current location. A week before the inauguration, a load test occurred with 48 fully laden trucks placed on the bridge's leaf. A 1960 extension lane increased the bridge's width from 8.5 metres (28 ft) to 12.5 metres (41 ft). A bike path and walking area were added as well. The horizontal clearance measures 98 feet (30 m).[2] Route 180 crosses the bridge.[3]

Until 1948, the Costa Rican government did not recognize Afro-Caribbean people as citizens and restricted their movement outside Limón province.[4]  As a result of this "travel ban", this Afro-Caribbean population became firmly established in the region, which influenced decisions not to move even after it was legally permitted. Nowadays, there is a significant outflow of Limón natives who move to the country's Central Valley in search for better employment and education.[5]  The Afro-Caribbean community speaks Spanish and Limonese Creole, a creole of English.

Lin's forceful opposition to the opium trade was a primary catalyst for the First Opium War. He is praised for his constant position on the "moral high ground" in his fight, but he is also blamed for a rigid approach which failed to account for the domestic and international complexities of the problem.[2] The Daoguang Emperor endorsed the hardline policies advocated by Lin, but then blamed Lin for the resulting disastrous war.[3]

His father, Lin Binri (林賓日), served as an official under the Qing government. He was the second son in the family. As a child, he was already "unusually brilliant".[4] In 1811, he obtained the position of advanced Jinshi (進士) in the imperial examination, and in the same year he gained admission to the Hanlin Academy. He rose rapidly through various grades of provincial service. He opposed the opening of China but felt the need of a better knowledge of foreigners, which drove him to collect material for a geography of the world. He later gave this material to Wei Yuan, who published the Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms in 1843. He became Governor-General of <link wikipedia="Hunan" osm="244080670 913073" type="node relation">Hunan</link> and <link wikipedia="Hubei" osm="913106" type="relation">Hubei</link> in 1837, where he launched a suppression campaign against the trading of opium.[3]
