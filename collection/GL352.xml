Its peak is 4,207.3 m (13,803 ft) above sea level, making it the highest point in the state of Hawaii. Most of the volcano is underwater, and when measured from its underwater base, Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain in the world,[6] measuring over 10,000 m (33,000 ft) in height. Mauna Kea is about a million years old, and has thus passed the most active shield stage of life hundreds of thousands of years ago. In its current post-shield state, its lava is more viscous, resulting in a steeper profile. Late volcanism has also given it a much rougher appearance than its neighboring volcanoes due to construction of cinder cones, decentralization of its rift zones, glaciation on its peak, and weathering by the prevailing trade winds. Mauna Kea last erupted 6,000 to 4,000 years ago and is now considered dormant.

It recalls the days of the "Last Great Railroad War" (construction 1909–1911) between the rival transportation empires of E. H. Harriman and James J. Hill, as they raced to build routes up the Deschutes River canyon, connecting the mainlines along the <link wikipedia="Columbia_River" osm="2183775" type="relation">Columbia River</link> to the new markets of Central Oregon. Harriman's Des Chutes Railroad Company built the house to the Union Pacific Common Standard Plan for buildings (with allowed variations) in 1910. It was one of three buildings in the "country combination station" at Maupin, and served as residence for the maintenance of way foreman for the local section of track. The other two buildings of the station (a depot and a bunk residence for the maintenance crew) were demolished by 1968. Most of the Des Chutes Railroad tracks in the canyon were abandoned in 1936, granting Hill the final victory in the race. The road passing in front of the house utilizes the former railroad grade.[1]

Plans were delayed by the start of <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link> but the citizens of Mercer County could see the benefit of building a flood control dam on Sandy Creek. The state, county, township and municipal authorities of the surrounding area worked together to push forward the idea of building the dam and recreational facilities in Mercer County. The land was acquired in the late 1960s. Construction on the dam began soon after and was completed in 1971. Maurice K. Goddard State Park was opened to the public in 1972.[3]

Each apartment was designed with an antechamber, a chamber, a cabinet, and a cloakroom. Originally, the building had a cupola, which was destroyed in a fire in 1704.[8]

Mayfield was established as the county seat of <link wikipedia="Graves_County,_Kentucky" osm="1846555" type="relation">Graves County</link> in 1821, and the county was formally organized in 1823. John Anderson is believed to have been the first European-American settler, arriving in 1819 and building a log home on Mayfield Creek. In December 1821, Anderson was appointed county court clerk and moved about two and a half miles to the site that became Mayfield. According to Trabue Davis, the town's name originates indirectly from a gambler named Mayfield, who was kidnapped about 1817 at a racetrack near what is now <link wikipedia="Hickman,_Kentucky" osm="130554" type="relation">Hickman</link>. He was carried to the site of today's Mayfield, where he carved his name into a tree in hopes that someone would see it. He tried to escape, but drowned trying to cross what is now called Mayfield Creek. The town took its name from the creek.[2]

They would have arrived in Montreal and traveled along the Ottawa river and then along the Blanche River.  The settlers would have found great comfort in their new surroundings, the hilly terrain resembling that of Ireland, and subsequently their new home was named Mayo after <link wikipedia="County_Mayo" osm="338539 4085175" type="relation relation">County Mayo</link> in <link wikipedia="Ireland" osm="7681896" type="relation">Ireland</link>.[7]  The main industries which drive the economics of the municipality were, and still are, farming and forestry as well as the manufacturing of potash.[6]

Hot springs abound, and there are two small crater lakes, Green Lake and Black Lake. These lie within two overlapping calderas formed in explosive eruptions 36,000 and 6,340 years ago. Mayor Island has exhibited a wide range of eruptive styles, including fire fountains, Strombolian explosions, extrusion of lava domes, phreatomagmatic explosions, Plinian falls and ignimbrite.
