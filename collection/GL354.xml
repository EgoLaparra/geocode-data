The island is the largest of the three Malaysian Turtle Islands that together comprise the <link wikipedia="Turtle_Islands_National_Park_(Malaysia)" osm="10002721" type="relation">Turtle Islands National Park</link>.[2] It covers a land area of 8.5 hectares.[3] It is at the very edge of the international treaty limits separating Malaysia from the <link wikipedia="Philippines" osm="26036352 443174" type="node relation">Republic of the Philippines</link>. Indeed, the island itself is referred to in the international border treaty concluded in 1930 between the <link wikipedia="United_States" osm="424317935 148838" type="node relation">United States</link> (in respect of its then overseas territory, the <link wikipedia="Philippines" osm="26036352 443174" type="node relation">Philippine Archipelago</link>) and the <link wikipedia="United_Kingdom" osm="838090640 62149" type="node relation">United Kingdom</link> (in respect of its then protectorate, the State of North Borneo). That treaty sets the international frontier as running in a straight line between Little Bakkungaan Island and Great Bakkungaan Island.[4] Great Bakkungaan Island is one of the <link wikipedia="Turtle_Islands,_Tawi-Tawi" osm="4635076470 37121646" type="node way">Philippine Turtle Islands</link> and less than 2km of water separate the two islands. This makes Little Bakkungaan Island the internationally recognised Malaysian territory that is closest to Philippine territory.[5] The island hosts a turtle hatchery.[6] The island is administered by Sabah Parks.[7] There are several buildings on the island used by park rangers as well as a peer. Much of the island is surrounded by beach.[8]

In 1960 a vast concentration of zinc and lead was discovered on the island during mapping for oil permits. Cominco acquired land in the area and a gravity survey in 1970 detected a large anomaly. By 1973 surface drilling and underground development had outlined the Polaris ore body and defined reserves of about 25 million tons grading approximately 14% zinc and 4% lead. A mining facility was constructed on a barge at <link wikipedia="Trois-Rivières" osm="207179911 4529678860 7711553" type="node node relation">Trois-Rivières, Quebec</link> and towed to the island; arriving in mid August 1981. Production commenced in 1982. The mile-long gravel runway allowed aircraft as large as the Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 to service the mine. The mine was closed in August 2002 as forecast due to depletion of the ore body. From 1982-2002 the mine processed 21 million tons of ore grading 3.72% lead and 15.81% zinc, producing 733,800 tons of lead metal and 2.8 million tons of zinc metal in concentrate. A two-year, $53 million decommissioning and reclamation program was completed in September 2004.

On the Fourth of July the island holds a huge community event which includes games, and a "Horribles Parade," ending with candy and donuts. In the middle of the dock is a large building which the islanders call the casino. Every Saturday night during the summer season a select number, about 5, families cook for the rest of the island. Therefore, in the casino, there is a kitchen, and a small library is housed on the second floor. Downstairs, accessible from the outside, is a tiny store. The island children call it the candy store. It sells island merchandise and, of course, candy. It has no schedule as it is run by numerous residents of the island, and is only open in the summer months.

This suggests that the church was built after 1436.[7] Kiilerich suggested an early Ottoman-era date for the church, perhaps connected with the takeover of the city's old cathedral—the Theotokos Atheniotissa in the <link wikipedia="Parthenon" osm="10973689" type="way">Parthenon</link>—by the Turks and its conversion into a mosque.[8]

The village is built on a boulder clay island surrounded by flat fenland countryside, typical of settlements in this part of the <link wikipedia="East_of_England" osm="151336" type="relation">East of England</link>. During the Mesolithic era, the fenland basin was mostly dry and forested, although subject to salt and fresh water incursions. The marshes and meres of this fenland may therefore have been difficult to occupy, other than seasonally, but there is evidence of human settlement on the island since the late Neolithic Age; a Bronze Age causeway linked the village with the nearby Barway, to the south-east. An investigation, prior to a 1995 development in the village, discovered a farm and large tile-kiln of Romano-British origin; further investigations uncovered an earlier settlement of the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The Roman road Akeman Street passed through the north-west corner of the parish, and the lost 7th century Anglo-Saxon village of Cratendune may be nearby.[2][3]

The river is approximately 400 kilometres (250 mi) long and drains an area of about 22,000 square kilometres (8,500 sq mi). The river is fed by rainfall and snowmelt, resulting in a peak discharge in spring and low water in summer and early fall. Two dams have been built on the Little Zab, regulating the river flow, providing water for irrigation and generating hydroelectricity. The <link wikipedia="Zagros_Mountains" osm="5130853663" type="node">Zagros Mountains</link> have been occupied since at least the Lower Palaeolithic, but the earliest archaeological site in the Little Zab basin, Barda Balka, dates to the Middle Palaeolithic.

Thus, the river flows through valleys that are predominantly aligned along a northwest–southeast axis, parallel to the major mountain chains of the Zagros, only to change its direction abruptly where it cuts through these chains in narrow gorges.[3] The Little Zab enters the plain south of Dukan, where it first assumes a roughly westward course before turning to the southwest upstream from the town of Altun Kopru and uniting with the Tigris near the town of <link wikipedia="Al_Zab" osm="2489253196" type="node">Al Zab</link>.[4] Most tributaries join the Little Zab upstream from Dukan, with the largest being the Baneh River and the Qala Chulan.[3] A number of smaller streams joined the Little Zab in the <link wikipedia="Ranya" osm="598459803" type="node">Ranya</link> Plain, which is now partly inundated by Lake Dukan.[5]
