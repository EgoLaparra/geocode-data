The first permanent settlements in what is now Mercer County were in 1837, when a few families from other parts of Missouri moved to the area. James Parsons, a <link wikipedia="Tennessee" osm="316994008 161838" type="node relation">Tennessee</link> native, is generally considered to be the first permanent settler, in the spring of 1837.[4] The land was still included as part of <link wikipedia="Livingston_County,_Missouri" osm="1180526" type="relation">Livingston County</link> at that time and would remain so until 1841 when it would become part of the newly created <link wikipedia="Grundy_County,_Missouri" osm="1180482" type="relation">Grundy County</link>. Prior to 1837, the land was used by Native American tribes, primarily the Sac/Fox and Potawatomi, as prime hunting grounds. The occasional temporary hunting village would be established by the tribes; otherwise, the land was devoid of humans. The town of Princeton, named for the battle where General Mercer was killed, was established as the county seat in 1847.[5] The northern boundary of the county was in dispute for the first six years of its existence due to the Honey War, a bloodless territorial dispute between <link wikipedia="Missouri" osm="473849775 161638" type="node relation">Missouri</link> and <link wikipedia="Iowa" osm="316955537 161650" type="node relation">Iowa</link>.

The station is constructed mostly of steel, with wooden platforms covered by a canopy most of their length. There are two side platforms both long enough to support eight-car trains, the longest possible on the CTA system. The southbound platform is just slightly below the level of the station entrance while an enclosed bridge over the tracks connects to the northbound platform on the opposite side. The station is fully accessible, resulting in a complicated elevator setup. The elevator on the southbound platform can lower from the entrance to the platform, as well as go up to the top of the bridge.

      <p id="GL357_250_002" num_links="2">Mercy Hospital traces its history to 1873 when the Superior of the Davenport house of the Sisters of Mercy entered into an agreement with the <link wikipedia="University_of_Iowa" osm="1579426" type="relation">University of Iowa</link> to operate a small hospital in the community.  At the request of <link wikipedia="Davenport,_Iowa" osm="151761785 129013" type="node relation">Davenport, Iowa</link> physician Washington Freeman Peck the Superior sent a group of nuns to Iowa City to help staff the hospital.  Dr. Peck and other physicians raised $5,000 to renovate a vacant school building known as Mechanics Academy into a 20-bed hospital.  This arrangement lasted until 1885, when the Sisters moved to a nearby vacant mission.  In 1886, the sisters established Mercy Hospital as an independent hospital.

      <p id="GL357_278_002" num_links="3">The earliest evidence of human settlement is a lake side village from the Late Bronze Age.  The lake has since silted up and is now part of the Rütiweid meadow.  The modern municipality of Merenschwand is first mentioned in the 12th Century as Meriswanden, though this comes from a 14th Century copy of the original.  In 1263 it was mentioned as Meriswandon.[4]  There are indications of a knightly family and a castle near Merenschwand, but no definitive evidence has been found.  Merenschwand was under the authority of the <link wikipedia="Homberg,_Bern" osm="240026789 1682483" type="node relation">Homberg</link> family until 1293, and then under the authority of the Lords of Hünenberg and Schär.  In 1393 Merenschwand bought its independence with the help of a loan from <link wikipedia="Lucerne" osm="560719199 1682891" type="node relation">Lucerne</link>.  As many of the former residents of the village had become citizens of Lucerne, in 1394 the village formally became part of the city of Lucerne and the residents were granted Lucerne citizenship.  Merenschwand thus became the center of the bailiwick of Merenschwand.  They chose their own vogt from among the patricians of Lucerne.  In 1810 and 1813 the municipalities of Mühlau and <link wikipedia="Benzenschwil" osm="240062933" type="node">Benzenschwil</link> joined the bailiwick.  Until 1798, the municipality enjoyed a relatively autonomous administration under a local bailiff.  The gasthof (combination hotel and restaurant) Zum Schwanen (from the 17th century) served as a court and community center.

After the War of 1812, Commodore David Porter, a naval hero of that war, acquired the hill in 1816 as part of a 110-acre tract of land that he had purchased; he named this property Meridian Hill. On the brow of this prominent hill on his new estate, and close to the marker, Porter then built a large and famous mansion which he also named Meridian Hill.[5] The home faced south with a dramatic view of the White House and the Potomac River. Meridian Hill Park today shares this view.
