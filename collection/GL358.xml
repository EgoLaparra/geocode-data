Lone Peak consists almost entirely of quartz monzonite (a granitoid, or granite-like) rock of the 30.5 million year old Little Cottonwood Stock.[3][4][5] Quartzite and limestone are also found in distal locations on the mountain. The mountain from Little Cottonwood Canyon on the northern end to Corner Canyon on the southern end is called "Mount Jordan", the highest peak of which is Lone Peak.

Long Pond is roughly one mile (1.6Â km) wide by four miles (6.4Â km) miles long, and contains three islands within its boundaries. In 1894 Assawompset Pond was dammed, increasing the water depth of Long Pond (which is connected by a small river) by about five feet (1.5Â m). This created Nelson Island and caused Sunken Island to disappear due to erosion. All that remains of Sunken Island are the rocks in a shallow area just to the northwest of Lewis Island. Lewis Island is the largest of the three remaining islands today, containing sixteen privately owned cottages, while the second largest island, Nelson Island, was purchased in 2005 and now is a year-round private residence. The smallest island, Goat Island, was recently purchased from the Boy Scouts by a private citizen. Along the perimeter of the lake are many homes and private access points to the waterfront. Long Pond is well known for fishing and boating.

The images, many once painted, were carved as outside rock reliefs and inside artificial caves excavated from the limestone cliffs of the Xiangshan (é¦å±±) and Longmenshan, running east and west. The Yi River (Chinese: ä¼æ²³) flows northward between them and the area used to be called Yique (ä¼é; 'The Gate of the Yi River').[1][2][3] The alternative name of "Dragon's Gate Grottoes" derives from the resemblance of the two hills that check the flow of the Yi River to the typical "Chinese gate towers" that once marked the entrance to Luoyang from the south.[4]
There are as many as 100,000 statues within the 2,345 caves, ranging from 1 inch (25Â mm) to 57 feet (17Â m) in height. The area also contains nearly 2,500 stelae and inscriptions, hence the name âForest of Ancient Stelae", as well as over sixty Buddhist pagodas. Situated in a scenic natural environment, the caves were dug from a 1 kilometre (0.62Â mi) stretch of cliff running along both banks of the river. 30% date from the Northern Wei and 60% from the Tang dynasty, caves from other periods accounting for less than 10% of the total.[3] Starting with the Northern Wei Dynasty in 493 AD, patrons and donors included emperors, Wu Zetian, members of the royal family, other rich families, generals, and religious groups.[1][5]
