According to the ASI, Lothal had the world's earliest known dock, which connected the city to an ancient course of the <link wikipedia="Sabarmati_River" osm="164775725" type="way">Sabarmati</link> river on the trade route between <link wikipedia="Harappa" osm="2960170283" type="node">Harappan</link> cities in <link wikipedia="Sindh" osm="316441014 357981" type="node relation">Sindh</link> and the peninsula of Saurashtra when the surrounding <link wikipedia="Kutch_district" osm="316417062 8269590" type="node relation">Kutch</link> desert of today was a part of the <link wikipedia="Arabian_Sea" osm="9328393" type="relation">Arabian Sea</link>.

He studied both law and medicine, but found his real vocation in politics, and quickly became a champion of the most advanced opinions. A member of the Carbonari society since 1824, he took an active part in most republican conspiracies during this period. In 1827, under the reign of Charles X (1824–1830), he participated in a street fight in Rue Saint-Denis, during which he was seriously injured. In 1829, he joined Pierre Leroux's Globe newspaper before taking part in the July Revolution of 1830. He then joined the Amis du Peuple ("Friends of the People") society, where he made acquaintances with Philippe Buonarroti, <link wikipedia="François-Vincent_Raspail" osm="2663285709" type="node">Raspail</link>, and Armand Barbès. He was condemned to repeated terms of imprisonment for maintaining the doctrine of republicanism during the reign of Louis Philippe (1830–1848).  During the 1832 trial of the Amis du People  at the cour d'assis in Paris Blanqui declared, "You have confiscated the rifles of July--yes.  But the bullets have been fired.  Every bullet of the workers of Paris is on its way round the world."[2][3]  In May 1839, a Blanquist inspired uprising took place in Paris, in which the League of the Just, forerunners of Karl Marx's Communist League, participated.

It is named  after the voortrekker leader Louis Tregardt; the original Venda name is Tshirululuni, and it is also informally known as Tshitandani. The whole region was known as Dzanani until 1946. It is the centre of the Makhado Local Municipality, which comprises 16,000 km² with a total population of 270,000 (2001). Louis Trichardt is located in a fertile region where litchis, bananas, mangoes and nuts are produced. The national road N1 runs through the town. Louis Trichardt is 437 kilometres from Johannesburg and one hour's drive from the Zimbabwean border at Beitbridge. Louis Trichardt was formerly known as Makhado, but it was changed back to Louis Trichardt.[2] But now many people use the one name or the other.[citation needed] Vleifontein, Elim, Tshikota, Madombidzha, Makhado Park and Dzanani surround the town at all directions.

      <p id="GL360_321_002" num_links="2">Like many other towns in South Africa, Louis Trichardt had its origins in Voortrekker settlement of the area. Two groups of Trekkers reached the Soutpansberg mountain range in 1836, one under the leadership of Louis Tregardt (born near Oudtshoorn, South Africa, 10 August 1783[3][4]) and another under Hans van Rensburg. Van Rensburg decided to lead his group to Sofala (near current <link wikipedia="Beira,_Mozambique" osm="259593578" type="node">Beira</link>), <link wikipedia="Mozambique" osm="424311658 195273" type="node relation">Mozambique</link>, but his entire party was killed en route.
