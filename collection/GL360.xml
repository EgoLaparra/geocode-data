Delming and consulting Norwegian-born engineer Olaf Hoff.[2] Construction on the bridge began in 1924, and the bridge opened in 1925. This bridge replaced the Niagara Cantilever Bridge that crossed in the same area from 1883 to 1925. The main traffic across the bridge were trains operated by the New York Central, Penn Central, Conrail, and Canadian Pacific Railway. It was also used briefly from October 1978 to January 31, 1979 by Amtrak's former Niagara Rainbow service which ran between <link wikipedia="New_York_City" osm="61785451 575213527 175905" type="node way relation">New York City</link> and <link wikipedia="Detroit" osm="18994998 134591" type="node relation">Detroit</link> via Niagara Falls and <link wikipedia="Windsor,_Ontario" osm="253421090 7025718" type="node relation">Windsor, Ontario</link>.

It has a Cassegrain telescope in its single dome. Built by Boller and Chivens, the Michigan State University telescope was commissioned in 1969 and entered regular operation in 1970. In 1974, what was at the time a state-of-the-art Raytheon Microcomputer was installed to function as a data gathering and control system.[1] Originally, single channel photoelectric photometry and photography using plates or film were the means of acquiring data. The observatory was closed from 1981 until 1986, at a time when the university was having financial difficulties.  It was reopened in the spring of 1986 on the occasion of the return of Comet Halley and has been in regular operation ever since.  Since the 1980s, a CCD camera has been employed as the main instrument and the Raytheon computer has been retired. The International Astronomical Union has assigned the MSU Observatory identification code 766.[2]

Construction was completed in 1520, the town hall received a facade with gothic windows, red-white shutters, smaller turrets and twenty-five statues of Zeeland's counts and countesses. The building has one main tower, which the Middelburgers call 'Malle Betje'. This mocking name comes from the fact it used to run behind the town's other clock tower, the 'lange Jan'. A meat-auction or 'meathall' used to be situated in the building, which had a separate entrance. Whereas the town hall itself is still used for weddings, since 2004 its spaces are in use by the University College Roosevelt, the local university. The former meat hall has been in use as an exhibition space for the SBKM since 1980.

The French and Indian Wars ended in 1763, and the first settlers arrived in 1766. John Chipman was the first to clear his land, Lot Seven.[7] During the Revolutionary War, much of the town was burned in Carleton's Raid on November 6, 1778. After the war concluded in 1783, settlers returned to rebuild homes, clear forests and establish farms. Principal crops were grains and hay.

      <p id="GL360_418_002" num_links="4">At one time, the community was known as Middle Station, and was a halfway point on the stagecoach route over Mt. St. Helena from Calistoga to Lower Lake. The first house was built at the site by J.H. Berry in 1870.[3] The town began in 1871.[3] The Middleton post office opened in 1871 and changed its name to Middletown in 1875.[3] Middletown enjoyed a robust quicksilver (mercury) mining industry through the end of the 19th century. By the early 1900s, cattle and sheep ranching were prominent, along with some limited pear and walnut production. A resort economy sprung up around the various natural springs, and the area around Middletown attracted vacationers from the Bay Area through the 1950s. As travel costs decreased, tourism to the resorts diminished as patrons were able use air travel to vacation in more far-flung places. Many of the resorts closed in the 1960s. In the 1970s and early 1980, exploitation of nearby geothermal energy resources brought an influx of workers into the local economy. Electrical power plants powered by "steam wells" were built in the mountains above Middletown. As housing prices in the Bay Area increased in the late 20th century, Middletown and nearby <link wikipedia="Hidden_Valley_Lake,_California" osm="33196801" type="way">Hidden Valley Lake</link> enjoyed a population boom as commuters moved to the Middletown area looking for affordable housing; keeping their jobs 50 to 100 miles away in <link wikipedia="Santa_Rosa,_California" osm="150934574 113158" type="node relation">Santa Rosa</link>, <link wikipedia="Napa,_California" osm="150960561 111735" type="node relation">Napa</link>, and <link wikipedia="San_Francisco" osm="26819236 111968 396487" type="node relation relation">San Francisco</link>.

      <p id="GL360_441_002" num_links="2">A railroad station in Middletown came with the construction of the New York and Long Branch Railroad, a subsidiary of the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Railroad. The site of the current Middletown station was part a farm owned by the Conover family. In 1875, the Conovers sold some of their land for $100 to build the railroad through the area. A new station was built in 1876 for the passenger service. After years of neglect, the station was repainted and rehabilitated in 1964 with attendance by descendants of the Conovers.[3] The high-level platforms were constructed in 1988 with the beginning of electric service down to <link wikipedia="Long_Branch_station" osm="297841603" type="node">Long Branch</link> from <link wikipedia="South_Amboy_station" osm="297839233" type="node">South Amboy</link>.

      <p id="GL360_443_001" num_links="4">The first white settler to own land in the village was Calvin G. Hill, a native of New York, who bought 400 acres (1.6 km2) in 1834 on both sides of the Thornapple River.[6] The village was likely surveyed and subdivided before 1850, but the plat was not officially recorded until 1859. Prior to 1843, the settlement was often called "Thornapple". The name Middleville was at first given to a post office on the stage coach line between <link wikipedia="Grand_Rapids,_Michigan" osm="153348187 134444" type="node relation">Grand Rapids</link> and <link wikipedia="Kalamazoo,_Michigan" osm="153800009 135028" type="node relation">Kalamazoo</link>. The post office was located at the house of Benjamin S. Dibble in section 2 in northeast Yankee Springs Township. Dibble had agreed to accept the post office at the request of <link wikipedia="United_States_House_of_Representatives" osm="5495145221" type="node">U.S. Representative</link> Lucius Lyon, of <link wikipedia="Kent_County,_Michigan" osm="1907319" type="relation">Kent County</link>. Lyon suggested the name "Dibbleville", but Dibble disliked that name. "Middleville" was suggested because of the proximity of an Indian village known as "Middle Village" on Scales Prairie near the boundary line between Thornapple and Yankee Springs townships.[7] Dibble was appointed postmaster in July 1839 and continued until 1842. The next postmaster, John W. Bradley, continued to maintain the post office at Dibble's house until 1843, when it was moved to the present village of Middleville, with Calvin G. Hill as the postmaster. The village afterwards became known by the name of the post office.[8][9][10]  The location of the original Indian village is NNE a few hundred yards of the present day intersection where Norris Rd. ends at Adams Rd.[citation needed]

Stalled cairns have a central passageway flanked by a series of paired transverse stones that separate the side spaces into compartments that reminded early investigators of horse stalls.[4]  The earliest versions of this tomb type are found in Caithness, and they typically consist of no more than four stalled compartments.[5]  In <link wikipedia="Orkney" osm="3067412" type="relation">Orkney</link>, the tombs became more elaborate; Midhowe is an extreme example of the form with twelve chambers flanking a passageway 23.6 metres (77 ft) in length.[6]  The transverse stones rise to a height of 2 metres (6.6 ft) and the walls still rise to a height of 2.5 metres (8.2 ft).[4]  Like most tombs in <link wikipedia="Orkney" osm="3067412" type="relation">Orkney</link>, the original roof is gone, replaced by a modern hangar-like structure that protects the site. The nature of the original roof is unclear; it may have consisted of flat slabs of flagstone at a height of 3 metres (9.8 ft) or more. Alternatively, it may have been vaulted like <link wikipedia="Maeshowe" osm="298344044" type="way">Maeshowe</link> to a height of as much as 5 metres (16 ft).[7]  The cairn appears to have been intentionally filled with debris after hundreds of years of usage beginning early in the third millennium BC.[8]
The size and complexity of the interior of the cairn must have exerted a powerful influence on those entering it. Castleden describes it this way:
