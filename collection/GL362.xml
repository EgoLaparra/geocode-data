Mikkeller was founded by two home brewers: Mikkel Borg Bjergsø, a high school teacher, and journalist Kristian Klarup Keller. Both sought to introduce their home-brewed beer to the public and to "challenge beer friends with intense new tastes",[3] drawing inspiration from the American breweries that "aren't afraid to play and break all the rules".[3]

In 1947 Mil became a head of OKB-4 design bureau in <link wikipedia="Tushino" osm="4913310420" type="node">Tushino</link>, and works were intensified. A final design was named GM-1 (for Gyelikopter Mila, Mil's Helicopter).Soviet engineers tried to create a completely original design. So, they made a rotor hub with spaced vertical and horizontal hinges. This design increased the efficiency of helicopter control and was much simpler than that used on American helicopters. The prototype completed first free flight on 20 September 1948 (pilot Mikhail Baikalov).[1] In 1949 it underwent official state trials. Despite crashes of two prototypes,[4] the design was an overall success, and after further work, was ordered for a production, under a new designation Mi-1, for Mil initials. The production was initially limited — the first series of only 15 machines was ordered on 21 February 1950, in factory No.3 in Moscow. Only after presentation to Joseph Stalin in 1951, the authorities decided to increase production. In 1952–1953, 30 Mi-1 were manufactured in <link wikipedia="Kazan" osm="174748794" type="way">Kazan</link>, and from 1954 a mass production started in <link wikipedia="Orenburg" osm="27505509" type="node">Orenburg</link> and from 1956 in <link wikipedia="Rostov" osm="27464486 941037 2324453" type="node relation relation">Rostov</link> (current Rostvertol).[1] The design was a subject of further improvements during production, mostly increasing reliability. Especially a rotor technology was changing. Period between repair increased to 300 hours in Mi-1T (hence a letter T for trekhsotchasovoi, 300-hour), 600 in Mi-1A, then to 1,000 and 3,000 hours by the end of production.

In 1861, there was an attempt to build one on Mill Creek, at the outlet of the Great Lakes but the attempt was abandoned after the Dakota-U.S. War of 1862 and the extremely low water level that year. In 1868 one was successfully built, and sawmill was built and put into operation in 1869. The mills began to attract many customers, and the small community began to grow around Old Town. In 1870, the company that operated the mill bought a section of land northwest of Old Town and laid out a plan for the town of Milford.[5]

It was formerly called "Moorabool" but the name was changed to avoid confusion with a locality near <link wikipedia="Geelong" osm="36701460" type="node">Geelong</link>. The name "Millbrook" was adopted because of a flour mill erected by Matthew Butterly on the West Moorabool creek.[2] At the time of the 2016 census, Millbrook had a population of 156[1] down from 550 in 2006,[3][4] partly reflecting changing boundaries. The soil is volcanic and well-adapted to cereals, potatoes and grazing. The landscape is undulating and preserves remnants of the original open forest. The West Moorabool creek runs through the district. The earliest inhabitants of the area were the Wathaurong, and the Irish were prominent among its European settlers in the mid-19th century.
