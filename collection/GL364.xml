Between the plain and the Arakan Yoma range is a distinct line of hills running north and south, and usually called the Nwa-Madaung hills. The submontane valleys are largely cultivated, but are deadly except to those born in them[clarification needed]. The chief streams besides the Ayeyarwady are the Mon, the Maw, and the Salin, which are largely used for irrigation. At Minbu the Ayeyarwady is 3 miles (4.8 km) wide, with many islands and sandbanks. There are considerable fisheries along the Ayeyarwady and on the Paunglin Lake, which is a lagoon fed from the Ayeyarwady. Oil has been discovered near the mud volcanoes of Minbu, but it seems to lie at too great a depth to be profitably worked.

      <p id="GL364_055_002" num_links="2">The facility is a two-way cycle track with a minor gradient. Completed in 2006 and entirely paved, it spans one of the four lengths of the fortified quadrangle created under Austrian rule during the first half of the 19th century. The cycleway is intended for bicycle touring.
Heading southwards, it starts near the Peschiera del Garda railway viaduct, on the right bank of the Mincio, passing over to the left bank just before the village of Monzambano, near the Salionze dam.
Shortly after this the castle of Valeggio sul Mincio, once a stronghold of the Veronese Scaligers, comes into view. This is followed by Borghetto sul Mincio, a settlement distinguished by its many watermills and the Ponte visconteo, a bridge erected by the Milanese House of Visconti.
From here it continues, still along the Mincio, as far as Pozzolo, where an alternative route leads to Volta Mantovana.
The track then veers away from the river, along the canals of the Mantuan plains.
After approximately 40 km it reaches the historic city of <link wikipedia="Mantua" osm="62505610 44232" type="node relation">Mantua</link>. Although the railway station is within easy reach, visitors are advised to continue along the cycling and pedestrian track which runs along the  Lago di mezzo (Middle Lake, one of the three basins formed by the Mincio, which wraps around the city), as far as the <link wikipedia="Ducal_palace,_Mantua" osm="203750182 1354420" type="way relation">Ducal Palace</link>, the very heart of town.
The cycleway is clearly signposted all the way and offers several rest stops with facilities. It is particularly popular in springtime (see the stats below).[2][3]

</p>
      <p id="GL364_079_002" num_links="7">The station was opened in 1848 as the terminus of the trunk line of the Cologne–Minden Railway Company (CME), connecting with the Royal Hanoverian State Railways’ Hannover–Minden line.  South of Minden the Cologne–Minden line passes through the gap created at <link wikipedia="Porta_Westfalica" osm="35687767 144696" type="node relation">Porta Westfalica</link> by the <link wikipedia="Weser" osm="123751" type="relation">Weser</link> river between the <link wikipedia="Wesergebirge" osm="3255241" type="relation">Weser</link> and <link wikipedia="Wiehen_Hills" osm="3209983 3255242" type="relation relation">Wiehen Hills</link>. The geography made it difficult to build the railway on the western side of the river through the gap to a station near Minden and then cross the river to continue to the east. Instead it was decided to cross the river at Rehme (near <link wikipedia="Bad_Oeynhausen" osm="32528322 144930" type="node relation">Bad Oeynhausen</link>), continuing north on the eastern bank through the gap, which was widened with explosives and then along a levee to a station built on the eastern bank of the river.  Both lines were completed on 15 October 1847. As it was a border station on one of the major routes for east-west traffic, it was originally highly fortified. In 1866 the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia, allowing the railway to operate continuously from <link wikipedia="Berlin" osm="240109189 62422" type="node relation">Berlin</link> to <link wikipedia="Cologne" osm="20953083 62578" type="node relation">Cologne</link> without frontiers. The fortifications around the station were abandoned in 1873.

      <p id="GL364_113_001" num_links="3">The first European settlement at Mineral Point began in 1827. One of the first settlers to the area was Henry Dodge and his family who settled a few miles away from Mineral Point.[7] During the following year, large quantities of galena, or lead ore, were discovered around the settlement in shallow deposits. Lead had many uses at the time, and settlers began to flock to the region hoping to make a living by extracting the easily accessible mineral. Lead deposits extended throughout an area that also included <link wikipedia="Dubuque,_Iowa" osm="151323772 128377" type="node relation">Dubuque, Iowa</link> and <link wikipedia="Galena,_Illinois" osm="151733080 126845" type="node relation">Galena, Illinois</link>, but Mineral Point became the center of lead mining operations within the bounds of present-day Wisconsin (then part of Michigan Territory). By 1829, the region's growing population led to the creation of <link wikipedia="Iowa_County,_Wisconsin" osm="1799446" type="relation">Iowa County</link>, which included all of the lead mining lands within the borders of Michigan Territory at the time. Mineral Point was established as the county seat later that year. During the Black Hawk War of 1832, residents of Mineral Point built Fort Jackson to protect the town from a possible attack.[8] The young settlement's importance was further confirmed in 1834 when it was selected as the site of one of two federal land offices responsible for distributing public land to settlers within the area that now encompasses Wisconsin.

      <p id="GL364_227_001" num_links="2">The history of Kazakh diplomacy dates back to the period of the Kazakh Khanate where the Khans initiated the development of diplomatic relations and implemented the foreign policy. The Khanate's main purpose in terms of diplomacy was to negotiate the expansion of territories, with the desire to create trade routes, the travel roads, and trade centres for international exchange.[1] The headquarters of the Kazakh khans had offices, which issued documents of a diplomatic and socio-economic nature. Kazakh khans appointed their envoys (known as ilchi), who were instructed to transmit messages and orders to neighboring rulers and governors.[2][3] The first modern Kazakh foreign ministry was formed in the early 1920s as the diplomatic office for the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.[4] This person who headed the Ministry was known as the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Turkestan ASSR, whose activities were regulated by the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of the Turkestan ASSR.[5] The position of a Minister of Foreign Affairs appeared in February 1944 after the adoption of the Soviet Law "On Submission of Powers to the Union Republics in the Field of Foreign Relations and on the Transformation of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs from the All-Union into Union-Republic People’s Commissariat".[6] This gave the Union republics the right to enter in direct relations with foreign states, however, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR performed all the main foreign policy functions. <link wikipedia="Kazakhstan" osm="424311521 214665" type="node relation">Kazakhstan</link>'s foreign ministry in its current form was founded in 1991 after the Kazakh SSR became the <link wikipedia="Kazakhstan" osm="424311521 214665" type="node relation">Republic of Kazakhstan</link> and gained its independence from the Soviet Union.

Lewis compiled a report on Minots Ledge, showing that more than 40 vessels had been lost due to striking the ledge from 1832 to 1841, with serious loss of life and damage to property. The most dramatic incident was the sinking of a ship "St John" in October 1849[6] with ninety-nine Irish immigrants, who all drowned within sight of their new homeland. It was initially proposed to build a lighthouse similar to John Smeaton's pioneering <link wikipedia="Eddystone_Lighthouse" osm="826383904" type="node">Eddystone Lighthouse</link>, situated off the south-west coast of <link wikipedia="England" osm="58447" type="relation">England</link>. However Captain William H. Swift, put in charge of planning the tower, believed it impossible to build such a tower on the mostly submerged ledge. Instead he successfully argued for an iron pile light, a spidery structure drilled into the rock.[7]

By 2007, however, the building was becoming outdated and Asda decided to rebuild it, but after haggling with the local authority Asda decided against this due to the costs demanded for environmental incentives and planning conditions deemed to be excessive by the company. The original store still remains there today.[2] However, the interior of the store was completely remodelled and more or less rebuilt. The exterior was also refreshed and from 2008, the store signage was changed to Asda Supercentre and the Walmart branding was removed.

In 1706, at the initiative of <link wikipedia="Peter_the_Great" osm="6204100696" type="node">Peter The Great</link>, the nearby Pharmaceutical Garden (later the University Botanical Garden) was founded. In the 1740s the street was completed between the Krestovsky Gate and the Kamer-Kollezhsky Val (now Rizhskaya Square).
