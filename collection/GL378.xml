The mountain reaches just above the bushline and can be climbed as a day hike without mountaineering equipment but is nevertheless a strenuous and steep climb and a full day should be allowed by the time access to the feet of the ranges is included. Access is gained either from the Wairarapa (eastern) side of the Remutaka Range from the Orongorongo River on the Wellington side of the range. New Zealand archaeologist George Leslie Adkin was a notable climber of Mount Matthews.[1] The species Rhypodes chinai is also native to Mount Matthews.[3]

      <p id="GL378_183_002" num_links="4">Mount Moran is a massive and impressive mountain which would make it attractive to mountaineers.  However, the comparative difficulty of the approach to the climbs makes it a much less popular climb than the <link wikipedia="Grand_Teton" osm="356511260" type="node">Grand Teton</link> and other peaks to the south.  No trails to Mount Moran have been maintained for over twenty years, and any approach overland requires a great deal of bushwhacking through vegetation, deadfalls and bogs along the perimeter of <link wikipedia="Leigh_Lake" osm="1121580" type="relation">Leigh Lake</link>.

As a result, most climbs on Mount Moran tend to take several days even when the technical portion of the climb is comparatively brief.

The mountain vegetation is largely composed of heath around the summit plateau with evergreen forest along the wetter eastern slopes and grassland to the western side. Annual rainfall totals are high (around 2200 mm) but long spells of dry weather occur during the winter period of May to August.

According to Greek mythology, this mountain was sacred to Dionysus and the Dionysian mysteries; it was also sacred to Apollo and the Corycian nymphs, and it was the home of the Muses.  The mountain was also favored by the Dorians. It is suggested that the name derives from parnassas, the possessive adjective of the Luwian word parna meaning house, or specifically temple, so the name effectively means the mountain of the house of the god.[2]

</p>
      <p id="GL378_302_002" num_links="4">Parnassus is one of the largest mountainous regions of Mainland Greece and one of the highest Greek mountains.

Its altitude is 2,457 meters and its highest peak is Liakouras. To the Northeast it is connected to Giona and to the south with Kirphe. Its name is due to the homonymous hero of the Greek mythology, son of Cleopompus (or Poseidon) and Cleodora, who had built on the mountain a city which was destroyed in the Deluge of Deukalion. Etymological analysis, however, shows a prehellenic origin of the name, relating it to the Pelasgians, and it appears to be from the Anatolian language Luwian.[2] 
The mountain is delimited to the east by the valley of the Boeotian Kephissus and to the West by the valley of <link wikipedia="Amfissa" osm="616542165" type="node">Amfissa</link>. The geological particularity of Parnassus is its rich deposits of <link wikipedia="Bauxite" osm="299277561" type="way">bauxite</link>, which has led to their systematic mining since the end of the 1930s, resulting in ecological damage to part of the mountain.[3]

It is located on the southern extremity of the city between the Yarrowee Creek and the White Horse Range. Physically it is largely cut off from the rest of Ballarat which contributes to a sense of a suburb apart. The traditional Wathaurung country was first invaded in 1836 when the Yuille brothers established a sheep run that included the sheltered corner under the escarpment later named Mount Pleasant. In those days, before there was a town at Ballarat, Buninyong was the nearest township. When the gold rush of 1851 brought thousands of diggers to nearby Golden Point, Mount Pleasant was left alone as no gold was initially found there. Its peacefulness made it attractive to a number of Cornish miners and their families who had come to Australia to settle permanently. These Wesleyans were the founders of the community. As devout and sober church people they sought a  place to live away from the drunken mayhem of the diggings around Main Road.

The spill flooded Polley Lake, its outflow Hazeltine Creek, and continued into nearby <link wikipedia="Quesnel_Lake" osm="2911480" type="relation">Quesnel Lake</link> and Cariboo River. By 8 August the four-square-kilometre (1.5 sq mi) sized tailings pond had been emptied of the majority of supernatant (process water) that sits atop the settled solids (mining waste, or 'tailings'). Water tests showed elevated levels of selenium, arsenic and other metals similar to historical tests before the disaster. The cause of the dam break has been investigated with a final report published 31 January 2015. Imperial Metals had a history of operating the pond beyond capacity since at least 2011.

      <p id="GL378_367_002" num_links="3">The Mount Polley open pit copper and gold mine disaster in the Cariboo region of <link wikipedia="British_Columbia" osm="305700699 390867" type="node relation">British Columbia</link> began in the early morning of 4 August 2014 with a partial breach of the <link wikipedia="Tailings" osm="601558572" type="way">tailings pond</link> dam, releasing 10 million cubic metres (10 billion litres; 2.6 billion US gallons) of water and 4.5 million cubic metres (4.5 billion litres; 1.2 billion US gallons)[2] of slurry into Polley Lake.[3]
Another source gives the quantity spilled as: 7.3 million cubic metres (7.3 billion litres; 1.9 billion US gallons) of tailings, 10.6 million cubic metres (10.6 billion litres; 2.8 billion US gallons) of water, and 6.5 million cubic metres (6.5 billion litres; 1.7 billion US gallons) of interstitial water.[4]
The slurry of tailings and process water carried felled trees, mud and debris and "scoured away the banks" of Hazeltine Creek which flows out of Polley Lake and continued into the nearby <link wikipedia="Quesnel_Lake" osm="2911480" type="relation">Quesnel Lake</link>. The spill caused Polley Lake to rise by 1.5 metres (4.9 ft).[5] Hazeltine Creek was transformed from a two-metre-wide (6.6 ft) stream to a 50-metre-across (160 ft) "wasteland"*[6]  and Cariboo Creek was also affected.[2]
As of 8 August 2014, a "slurry of toxic water and mud" continued to pour into Quesnel Lake.[6] By the end of the day the four-square-kilometre (1.5 sq mi) sized tailings pond was "virtually empty".[2][5]
Mine safety experts and media articles have called the spill one of the biggest environmental disasters in modern Canadian history.[7][8] British Columbia’s government initially insisted the dam failure was not an environmental disaster but stated "We will have a much better idea 24 hours from now on the quality in Quesnel Lake," ,[9] a position clarified again by British Columbia’s Environment Minister, Mary Polak, in November 2014 after more sampling data became available.[10]
