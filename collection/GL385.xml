It is internationally renowned for the wines it produces and included within the Great Wine Capitals of the World. The region was named after either David McLaren, the Colonial Manager of the South Australia Company or John McLaren (unrelated) who surveyed the area in 1839. Among the first settlers to the region in late 1839, were two English farmers from Devon, William Colton and Charles Thomas Hewett. William Colton established the Daringa Farm and Charles Thomas Hewett established Oxenberry Farm. Both men would be prominent in the early days of McLaren Vale.  Although initially the region's main economic activity was the growing of cereal crops, John Reynell and Thomas Hardy planted grape vines in 1838 and the present-day Seaview and Hardy wineries were in operation as early as 1850. Grapes were first planted in the region in 1838 and some vines more than 100 years old are still producing. Today there are more than 88 cellar doors in McLaren Vale. The majority are small family-run operations and boutique wineries.

Soon, he and his wife and young son, together with a number of newly freed slaves, moved from Louisiana to live on and work the new farm. When the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (Frisco) came through the area 30 years later, a small passenger and freight station was built, and a post office to serve the small community was set up across the road in the back of the general store that was operated by the McNabs. Custom of the time allowed the person who operated the post office to give it a name. Mrs. Charles F. McNab, who was the postmistress, named it "McNab". Her son, Charles West McNab, who had farmed the land until 1927 and was the only grandson of the original owner, sold the last 40 acres (160,000 m2) of family property there in 1956.[citation needed]

      <p id="GL385_319_002" num_links="2">The quiet community of Meadowview was called Meadow View (two separate words) until the 1930s.  Native American trails passed near the later site of the town.  The first settler was James Glenn, who purchased land in 1783.  Different theories exist regarding the origin of community's name.  Some believe the name may come from an early name of Meadow Mountain, the name for nearby <link wikipedia="Whitetop_Mountain" osm="356587081" type="node">Whitetop Mountain</link> on the 1749 Peter Jefferson Map.  Another explanation is that William Edmondson named his house Edmondson's Meadow and enjoyed looking at the numerous green meadows surrounding his house.  Until the railroad's arrival in 1856, the town was small and remote.  After the train arrived, stockyards and a transportation center were established in Meadowview to ship livestock, produce and goods to all over the eastern <link wikipedia="United_States" osm="424317935 148838" type="node relation">US</link>.

Its main theatre (or Grosses Haus) seats 650 people and is used for the performance of plays, opera, musical theatre and ballet. Designed by Georg Daniel, it was built between 1883 and 1886 after the previous theatre had been destroyed by fire in 1882. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 October 1886 with a performance of Gluck's Iphigénie en Aulide with Marie Wittich in the title role. The complex also includes the State Museum in Schwerin (<link wikipedia="Staatliches_Museum_Schwerin" osm="25538032" type="way">Staatliche Museum Schwerin</link>) and a 240-seat concert hall, now used for performances of chamber works. All theatres were closed for the Autumn season of 1944, with the staff drafted wherever possible. By German WW2 standards wartime casualties and destruction by bombing in Schwerin were small, in spite of nightly RAF raids and the droning of massive bomber pulks as silver specks on the sky during the day on their way to Berlin.  Americans were the first to enter the town in the spring of 1945, handing it over to the British until the Russians arrived. These ordered the immediate reopening of the theatre, taking great interest in light operas and operettas as an art they very much appreciated, but until then out of their reach in most parts of Stalin's Soviet Union. Not familiar with Central European culture, one saw their well-fed ladies wearing night gowns during the invariably full houses as a substitute for an evening dress.  In the immediate years to follow, there was a gradual exodus of key staff to the West, where few found equivalent employment.  The ensuing vacancies provided new chances for many musicians, who were prepared to stay in East Germany to gain important positions there in their later career.
