This remarkable feature, a hexagonal tower, rises near the intersection of three ranges of buildings, filled above the level of adjoining roofbeams with banks of tall arched windows of many leaded panes that offer views in every direction over the rolling landscape of the park and the countryside beyond.

The placename "Meliden" has variously been claimed to be derived from that of Bishop Melitus or St. Melyd (the village has the church of St. Melyd as its main place of worship); its Welsh placename, "Gallt Melyd", means "wooded hill of Melyd".[1] The railway between Prestatyn and Dyserth, long since lifted and formerly with sidings in the village, is now a public walkway and nature trek. It has a 9-hole golf course, which is split in half by the former railway/nature walk. The local school, St. Melyd Primary, is a feeder school to the High School, Prestatyn.

The falls have been drawing visitors for at least two centuries – they are certainly known to have inspired J. M. W.

</p>
      <p id="GL387_382_002" num_links="2">With the invasion of Poland by the Third Reich on September 1, 1939, started a war conflict of unprecedented scale and intensity, waged everywhere and by all means, so that historians, using the term originated during the war, rightly called it "total war". The Axis powers waged the war to such an extent wantonly, that all the valid regulations of international law were virtually violated, and crimes that they committed were of such scope and character, that it was necessary to create for them the new provisions of international public law. Images of hunger, gas chambers, crematoria, mass executions, almost dead people as the result of "scientific experiments", were a reality in which lived and died millions of Europeans. Humiliated, in pain and suffering, they were deprived of their elementary status of human being and reduced to occurrence, number, statistical data, and in best case, to manpower, useful and necessary only to the limit of physical strength. From 1941 to 1944, the population of <link wikipedia="Serbia" osm="369137525 1741311 9088937" type="node relation relation">Serbia</link> and <link wikipedia="Belgrade" osm="60571493 391994940 2728438" type="node way relation">Belgrade</link>, through the entire system of prisons, concentration camps and execution places, was included in this image of collective suffering. Immediately after the German occupying troops entered Belgrade on April 12, 1941, began reprisals against population. They introduced the practice of constant holding of hostages and the threat of their execution, if in any way resisted the occupier. The establishment of concentration camps in "Topovske šume"[1] in Autokomanda (urban area of Belgrade), in Banjica (urban area of Belgrade) in barracks of 18th Infantry Regiment, the concentration camp Sajmište[2] in the facilities of the former Fair Complex on the left bank of the Sava river and "Milišića ciglana" in Zvezdara (urban area of Belgrade), marked the destiny of Belgrade in a very special way. It was the only capital city in occupied Europe, on whose urban land were formed concentration camps. The executions, organized and conducted by German occupying forces, lasted every day from July 15, 1941 until the end of 1943. The liquidation of hostages and prisoners was conducted at several locations in Belgrade and its surroundings: Bežanijska kosa, Jewish Cemetery, Bubanj Potok, Central Cemetery, Мarinkova bara, villages of Jabuka, Skela, Mali Požarevac, Ralja.

The monument area is in the foot of a hill, and is set off with a wall bearing the motto of <link wikipedia="Tadeusz_Kościuszko" osm="3822461957 2518901" type="node relation">Tadeusz Kościuszko</link>, "For your freedom and ours," in Polish (Za waszą i naszą wolność) and German (Für eure und unsere Freiheit), and a relief showing figures of a Polish and Red Army soldier together with a German resistance fighter. Below the columns is the dedicatory plaque, in Polish, German, and Russian, where wreath-laying ceremonies take place.

Therefore, the statue was preserved during centuries of Muslim rule in this region. This image was found in a cave in 1179 over which D.F. Roupinho had the hermitage constructed in 1182 on the edge of the cliff.[2] In 1616 a historian of the Kingdom, Bernardo de Brito visited Sitio to fulfill a vow, where he attempted to find the cave the image was found from.[1] He excavated the basement of the Chapel with the help of other devotees, and succeeded to find the cave. According to the legends, whoever attempted to go too far inside the cave, disappeared. Once a priest accompanied by his dog tried to enter the cave attached to a long rope and never came back, so a wall was built to prevent access to the remotest part of the cave and grids were placed in its entrance. Visitors can only see the entrance of the cave on which there is a niche the image of Our Lady placed.
