It is located to the east of the <link wikipedia="Cairo_Governorate" osm="4103336" type="relation">Cairo Governorate</link> and consists mostly of condominia. It was established in the 1960s as an extension to neighboring settlement of Heliopolis. The establishment of the district was part of the Egyptian Government's plan to modernise and expand Cairo following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian President at the time, was involved personally in the design process, and was the one who chose the name Nasr for the new district ("nasr" being the <link wikipedia="Arabic" osm="6271347691" type="node">Arabic</link> word for "victory"). During the early stages of the project it was envisioned that it would constitute a new capital city.[3]  Now, Nasr City is extremely crowded, much more than was expected from the creation of the district, because of Egyptian families relocating to the district and also because of Somali and  South Sudanese immigration to areas of Nasr City such as Hay El Asher (10th Neighbourhood).

The eagle or Thunderbird also symbolizes the Creator and embodies the spirit of the Aboriginal people.[5] Below the eagle are four human figures, facing the four points of the compass and representing First Nations, Inuit and Métis. Pinay felt it was very important to incorporate female figures in the sculpture to acknowledge the role of women not only as nurses, but as those responsible for maintaining families while the men were away.[3] The human figures hold not only weapons but also spiritual objects: an eagle feather fan and a peace pipe. There are four animal figures, one on each corner to act as spirit guides, each with a special attribute: a wolf (family values), a buffalo (tenacity), an elk (wariness) and a bear (healing powers).[3]

In 1981, Holiday Inn announced that it would sell the entire collection, a decision that received some opposition. Nevada governor Robert List attempted to delay the sale while working on a plan to have the state enact legislation that would save the collection. Businessman Thomas Perkins later led a group that was interested in purchasing the collection. Both efforts to save the collection failed. However, a nonprofit organization was formed that ultimately resulted in the construction of the museum. Holiday Inn donated 175 of Harrah's automobiles to the group, while the remainder of his collection was sold during three auctions in the mid-1980s. Another 60 vehicles were donated to the group by private owners.

The original size of the elk herd has been estimated to have been in excess of 25,000. By the end of the 19th century, the town of Jackson had developed on important winter range and blocked off some of the migration routes used by the elk. The elk herd was severely reduced in size due to the hostile climate and lack of food supply, in addition to hunting pressures by both homesteaders and surrounding Native American tribes (Bannock). </p>
