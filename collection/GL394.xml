In 1861, there was an attempt to build one on Mill Creek, at the outlet of the Great Lakes but the attempt was abandoned after the Dakota-U.S. War of 1862 and the extremely low water level that year. In 1868 one was successfully built, and sawmill was built and put into operation in 1869. The mills began to attract many customers, and the small community began to grow around Old Town. In 1870, the company that operated the mill bought a section of land northwest of Old Town and laid out a plan for the town of Milford.[5]

The King Philip's War destroyed the town in 1676, but settlers returned in 1680.[2] The Mill River flows through Milford and had several conspicuous fords that were familiar to the Native Americans, and used by the early white settlers. These "mill (river) fords" gave Milford its name.[3]
Milford was incorporated April 11, 1780 and the first Town Hall built in 1819; a brick structure later named the Town House School. The <link wikipedia="Milford_Town_Hall" osm="214579986" type="way">Milford Town Hall</link> was built in 1854 by architect Thomas Silloway.[2]

The park contains 19 identified archaeological sites, making it one of the most significant archaeological collections in Minnesota.  The earliest site dates to the Archaic period and shows evidence of copper tool manufacture.  The Sioux lived in this area roughly until the 18th century, when many bands of Sioux were moving southward into the prairies and river areas of southern Minnesota.  At the same time, Ojibwe (Anishinaabe) were moving in from the east.  Ojibwe oral tradition, published by William Whipple Warren, suggests that there was a battle in which they successfully took control of the area from the Sioux.

Mills convinced the Southern Railway to put in a siding, and in 1897, he opened the mill with 5,000 spindles and about two hundred employees, mostly former tenant farmers from the mountains of North and South Carolina. By 1903, there were 120 houses and a thousand residents in the mill village; in 1907 there were 450 employees and 27,000 spindles in a mill that produced cotton bed sheets, twills, and satin. Workers pastured their cows on the flood plain and put outhouses, pig sties, and chicken coops behind their residences.  The mill also built a company store, a church used alternately by Baptist and Methodist congregations, and a <link wikipedia="YMCA" osm="2649600552 3057900245 461748938 3532261" type="node node way relation">YMCA</link> that employed two paid social workers.[3]
