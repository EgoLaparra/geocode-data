Construction began in 1904 and by 1906 most of the dam's canals and laterals were finished. By 1909, Minidoka Dam's power plant, the first federal power plant in the northwest, was completed.[3] By its completion, the total cost of the dam was $5.8 million, which exceeded estimates.

Kazakh khans appointed their envoys (known as ilchi), who were instructed to transmit messages and orders to neighboring rulers and governors.[2][3] The first modern Kazakh foreign ministry was formed in the early 1920s as the diplomatic office for the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.[4] This person who headed the Ministry was known as the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Turkestan ASSR, whose activities were regulated by the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of the Turkestan ASSR.[5] The position of a Minister of Foreign Affairs appeared in February 1944 after the adoption of the Soviet Law "On Submission of Powers to the Union Republics in the Field of Foreign Relations and on the Transformation of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs from the All-Union into Union-Republic People’s Commissariat".[6] This gave the Union republics the right to enter in direct relations with foreign states, however, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR performed all the main foreign policy functions. <link wikipedia="Kazakhstan" osm="424311521 214665" type="node relation">Kazakhstan</link>'s foreign ministry in its current form was founded in 1991 after the Kazakh SSR became the <link wikipedia="Kazakhstan" osm="424311521 214665" type="node relation">Republic of Kazakhstan</link> and gained its independence from the Soviet Union.

Construction works were carried out by the Indian company IVRCL and the Spanish company Abengoa, under the direction of the Project Manager Fernando Portillo Vallés and the Construction Manager Juan Ignacio Jiménez-Velasco, who returned to Europe after the inauguration of the plant to work on Renewable Energy Projects.[1] Originally scheduled to be operational by January 2009, the work on the plant was delayed due to Cyclone Nisha in October 2008, which damaged a portion of the completed marine works and destroyed the cofferdam meant for the installation of transition pipes.[1] The trial runs were completed in June 2010 and the plant was opened in July 2010.[1] Water from the plant will be utilised chiefly for industrial purposes such as the Ennore Port and North Chennai Thermal Power Station. However, during droughts, water from the plant will be supplied to the public, serving an estimated population of 1,000,000.[1]

The most dramatic incident was the sinking of a ship "St John" in October 1849[6] with ninety-nine Irish immigrants, who all drowned within sight of their new homeland.

By 2007, however, the building was becoming outdated and Asda decided to rebuild it, but after haggling with the local authority Asda decided against this due to the costs demanded for environmental incentives and planning conditions deemed to be excessive by the company. The original store still remains there today.[2] However, the interior of the store was completely remodelled and more or less rebuilt. The exterior was also refreshed and from 2008, the store signage was changed to Asda Supercentre and the Walmart branding was removed.

The Miracle Mile Historic District follows the alignment of the following extant arterials: Stone Avenue, Drachman Street, Oracle Road, and Miracle Mile. Also included in the district and associated with the highway site is a two block segment of Main Avenue lined with trucking transfer warehouses and roadside commercial buildings, as well as four blocks of Flores Street containing a cluster of small motels. The bulk of the contributing resources, facing or within one block of the historic highway alignment, relate to mid‑century auto culture and were constructed in 1920 through 1963 during the district's period of significance. While the district has been rendered discontiguous by development, the identified segments have sufficient significance and integrity to meet National Register criteria.[3] Two designated highways are routed down the Miracle Mile Historic District. The Stone Avenue, Drachman Street and Oracle Road segments of the Historic District are part of Historic U.S. Route 80, while the West Miracle Mile segment is part of <link wikipedia="Arizona_State_Route_77" osm="1501157" type="relation">Arizona State Route 77</link>.[4][5]
