The project was announced in the middle of May 1942 and construction began almost immediately. Thirty-four farm families were displaced from the main site, along with those living at the auxiliary sites.  Construction was rapid given the emergency wartime conditions and within three months the post was to be in full operation. The airfield consisted of four concrete runways 4907x150(N/S), 5004x150(NE/SW), 5000x150(E/W), 5000x150(NW/SE), plus associated taxiways, landing aids, and an extended length parking apron.

However, John Newton's heroics are said to be a product of Parson Weems, who also fictionalized the story of George Washington and the cherry tree. In 1853, disputes led to the building of a courthouse and town in the county's geographical center instead of in Burkeville, a community 11 miles north northeast of Newton. A second courthouse in Newton, a Second Empire style structure, was built in 1902-03 with bricks from nearby Caney Creek, according to a Texas Historical Commission marker. The town was incorporated in 1935 and remains the only incorporated city in the county. The town's public school began when the W.H. Ford Male and Female College was chartered in 1889. The site of the college later became the Powell Hotel and now serves as a museum and houses the city's chamber of commerce. The growth of the city during the first half of the 20th century was largely due to the dominant timber industry in East Texas. The town had at least one newspaper prior to 1920s. The county courthouse, a focal point of a city square that featured extensive Christmas lighting in the early 1990s, was severely damaged by a fire in August 2000. Various funding and other problems pushed back the time frame for the restoration of the edifice for several years. Completion of the rebuilding is estimated to be sometime in 2008. Although almost 80 miles from the <link wikipedia="Gulf_of_Mexico" osm="305639190" type="node">Gulf of Mexico</link>, Newton suffered extensive damage in September 2005 from Hurricane Rita.

The current house was built by Edward Rice in the Jacobean style in 1660, though extensive changes were made in the 1850s in the Venetian Gothic style. The house played a role in the Rebecca Riots of 1843, when the occupant of the house at the time, Colonel George Rice, received a death threat with an empty grave dug in the ground. After 1956 the property fell into turbulent times when two owners died within the space of a few years. It was sold in 1974, and later fell into disrepair; it was occupied by squatters and thieves who removed beams and furniture.

A mission hospital known as St Joseph's Hospital renders both basic and most crucial health services in and around Nguludi. There is also St Joseph's College of Nursing which trains future medical personnel. It also has the biggest church for the Nguludi parish whose out-station churches are: Chitambuli, Mombezi, Nchocholo, St Theresa(aka Sachima, Makunami or ku Senti), Naphiyo, Likhomo, Njuzi and Kwanjana. The mission was established by Missionaries of Africa and the Marist Fathers in 1901. It was ransacked in the Chilembwe Rising of 1915. It also boasts of a small museum which is usually used as an out-station by the Department of Antiquities which is headquartered in Malawi's capital city, Lilongwe.
