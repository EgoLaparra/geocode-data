In 1905 the Nordstrand congregation was established, and the following year the church changed its name again to Nordstrand Church.  The church was built in red brick in neo-Gothic style by architect Jacob Wilhelm Nordan. In 1886 a sacristy was added, and in 1935 it was extended and given a new church tower to the west, drawn by architect Georg Greve.[1][2]  The last and largest expansion took place in 2014 to 2015. Then the church was extended 26 meters to the east and the church congregation got new facilities in the basement. The number of seats in the church room was increased from approx. 300 to 480. Architects for the remodeling work were Are Meinich and Trine-Lise Sonne. The church was reconsecrated on Sunday, August 23, 2015 by bishop of Oslo Ole Christian Kvarme.[3]

Since huge assets as much as US$840 billion are managed by only around 3,200 employees, the bank is mainly engaged in asset management and large scale corporate financing. The asset management division is constituted of more than 300 MBA holders from top-tier schools. Its members include cooperative federations such as the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA) and the Japan Fishery Cooperatives (JF). Norinchukin supports political lobbies who oppose agricultural imports and the deterioration of living standards in rural areas. Norinchukin has 41 offices throughout Japan and five overseas branches.

</p>
      <p id="GL402_287_002" num_links="2">The Norinchukin Bank was founded on December 20, 1923 by the Japanese government to support the country's agriculture industry. Norinchukin is derived from the bank’s Japanese name Nō - Rin - Chūō - Kinko (Agriculture - forestry - central - credit union). Norinchukin suffered from a lack of investment funds during <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>, due to restrictions by the Japanese government.  After the war, Norinchukin played an important role in rebuilding the country. Once the government encouraged divestment in the textile industry, Norinchukin formed a political lobby to support the agriculture sector. In 1979, Norinchukin set up an international department and formed a relationship with the <link wikipedia="Bank_of_Japan" osm="3069611" type="relation">Bank of Japan</link>. Low interest rates in the 1980s impacted Norinchukin's profitability. The Japanese government adjusted the charter of Norinchukin in 1986 and allowed the bank to operate as a commercial bank. Following the global recession in 2008, Norinchukin indicated it had ¥9.7 billion in losses related to the subprime mortgage crisis.[1][2] For the 2009 fiscal year, Norinchukin posted a net income of ¥29.5 billion.

During the ensuing crisis, the Swedish Attorney General, Lennart Geijer permitted to bring Olsson's his alleged friend Clark Olofsson from a prison to the bank. Olofsson was an infamous criminal years before this event, and it's doubtful he was in league with the unknown robber. [2]
Still the two bonded with the hostages, who acted to protect their captors despite being repeatedly threatened by them. The police mounted a tear gas attack five days into the crisis, and the robbers surrendered. Olsson was sentenced to 10 years for the robbery, while Olofsson was ultimately acquitted. The paradoxical actions of the hostages led to a great deal of academic and public interest in the case, including a 2003 Swedish television film and a 2018 American film.

In 1709, the matter was brought to the General Court, which set aside two parish churches, north and south.[4]  The parishes grew apart as the years went on and on April 7, 1855, the North parish separated from the south and was incorporated as North Andover.
