It is located in the state capital of <link wikipedia="Raleigh,_North_Carolina" osm="158618991 179052" type="node relation">Raleigh</link> on Union Square at One East Edenton Street. The cornerstone of the Greek Revival building was laid with Masonic honors by the Grand Master of North Carolina Masons Simmons Jones Baker on July 4, 1833.[4] Construction was completed in 1840.[5] It was designed primarily by the architectural firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis.  Often credited solely to that team, the design of the capitol was actually the result of a sequence of work by William Nichols, Sr. and his son William Nichols, Jr., Town and Davis, and then David Paton.[6]
The Capitol housed the entire state government until 1888, and the North Carolina General Assembly met in the capitol building until 1961. The legislature relocated to its current location in the <link wikipedia="North_Carolina_State_Legislative_Building" osm="47776644" type="way">North Carolina State Legislative Building</link> in 1963. The <link wikipedia="North_Carolina_Supreme_Court" osm="47760090" type="way">North Carolina Supreme Court</link> has also convened in the building in the past, most recently meeting in the capitol's senate chamber in 2005 while the Supreme Court Building was undergoing renovations. The Governor and the governor's immediate staff has continued to occupy offices in the building.[7] The Capitol remains largely unaltered from its 1840 state. Only three rooms have been significantly altered through remodeling: the two committee rooms in the east and west wings of the second floor, which were divided horizontally to provide space for restrooms, and the office in the east wing of the first floor, part of which had to be cut away to permit space for an elevator to be installed in 1951.[8] The Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973 and the building is located in the Capitol Area Historic District.[2][9]

</p>
      <p id="GL403_378_002" num_links="3">At its creation in 1963, it was largely farmland on the western edge of development in Broward County.  North Lauderdale was originally grazing pasture for cows and horses of the Anderson Dairy Farm and also an agricultural area for the Lena Lyons Stringbean Farm.  Recognizing a rare opportunity to work with a blank slate, famed architect Morris Lapidus turned his attention to planning a city that would become North Lauderdale.  Lapidus gained international notoriety for launching the 1950s “<link wikipedia="Miami_Beach,_Florida" osm="154141895 118856" type="node relation">Miami Beach</link>” style resort hotel.  His design of the <link wikipedia="Fontainebleau_Miami_Beach" osm="1038908658" type="node">Fontainebleau Resort</link>, the <link wikipedia="Eden_Roc_Miami_Beach_Hotel" osm="135296603" type="way">Eden Roc</link> and Americana helped create the style of Miami Beach.  After hotels, Lapidus turned to designing cities.  North Lauderdale, “The City of Tomorrow”, was the first city he laid out.  Residents still benefit from his influence and vision, which can be seen in the whimsical “beacons” lending the city prominence and in the distinct, amoebic shape of Boulevard of Champions.  In the late 60's, recognizing the growing demand for single-family homes, the Osias Organization, headed by Colonel Nathan Rood, who was also the first appointed Mayor, purchased most of the land and began the development of North Lauderdale proper.  In April 1969, by straw vote, Michael Saraniero became the City's first elected Mayor.
