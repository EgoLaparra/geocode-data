It is also applied to Northwest Landing at Northwest Creek (a saltwater outlet from the inlet to the harbor) which was the first port for East Hampton and which became a major whaling port in the late 17th and early 18th centuries[2] until it was replaced by Sag Harbor two miles to the west of the landing, where the water was deeper.

From the latter part of the 1970s onwards, a considerable number of historical aircraft were assembled in an old ex-Luftwaffe hangar at Gardermoen and from the mid-1980s the public were admitted to the hangar during summer.

It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the last of his eight cenotaphs to be erected in England. Prior to Lutyens' involvement, several abandoned proposals had been made for commemorating Norwich's war dead, and by 1926 the newly elected lord mayor was determined to see the construction of a memorial before he left office. He established an appeal to raise funds for local hospitals in memory of the dead as well as a physical monument. He commissioned Lutyens, who designed an empty tomb (cenotaph) atop a low screen wall from which protrudes a Stone of Remembrance. Bronze flambeaux at either end can burn gas to emit a flame. Lutyens also designed a roll of honour, on which the names of the city's dead are listed, which was installed in <link wikipedia="Norwich_Castle" osm="38329530" type="way">Norwich Castle</link> in 1931.

      <p id="GL405_460_002" num_links="6">Notre Dame Preparatory School (NDP) was founded on September 21, 1873 in Baltimore, Maryland on Charles Street by the School Sisters of Notre Dame, under the name  Notre Dame of Maryland Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies. There were 63 pupils. The school was founded due to overcrowding at the SSND's first school in <link wikipedia="Baltimore" osm="671113 154196553 133345" type="node node relation">Baltimore</link>, <link wikipedia="Institute_of_Notre_Dame" osm="546900211" type="way">Institute of Notre Dame</link>. <link wikipedia="Ulysses_S._Grant" osm="2512519" type="relation">Ulysses S. Grant</link>, President of the United States, presided over the first commencement as his niece, Bessie Sharp, was a student at the school in 1876. Notre Dame's preparatory school existed 20 years before the college. In response to the high school graduates' requests in the early 1880s, the School Sisters of Notre Dame expanded Notre Dame of Maryland's curriculum with two years of post-secondary education. This led to the charter of the college on April 2, 1896. Although the school has always been for girls, in the early 1900s, boys were admitted. The sisters began to admit them, it is believed, at the urging of Cardinal James Gibbons for the convenience of some Baltimore families. In more than one school catalogue, the sisters assigned girls' names to the boys. In another, they penciled in "B" above each boy's name. By the late 1920s, however, the school was once again all-female.[2]
In an attempt to distinguish the prep school from the College of Notre Dame of Maryland (now <link wikipedia="Notre_Dame_of_Maryland_University" osm="114709361" type="way">Notre Dame of Maryland University</link>) and to meet the growing demand for classroom space, the school moved in 1960 to the current Hampton Lane campus in the <link wikipedia="Hampton,_Maryland" osm="158581075" type="node">Hampton</link> neighborhood of <link wikipedia="Towson,_Maryland" osm="3679001328" type="node">Towson, Maryland</link>.[3]

The church was built from 1889 to 1892, replacing an earlier church built in 1865 at a different site. French Canadian architect Gregoire Vigeant designed the church in the Romanesque Revival style; the design has a heavy French influence which can be seen in its Greek cross layout, its hipped roofs and square domes, and the emphasis on height suggested by its two cupolas and its lantern. Due to the declining size of its original French congregation, the Archdiocese of Chicago gave control of the church to the Fathers of the Blessed Sacrament in 1918. The church hosted the International Eucharistic Congress in 1926.[2]
