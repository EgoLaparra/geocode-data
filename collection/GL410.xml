The first station building was dominated by a waiting hall open to the track side, at the northern end of which there was a waiting room of 3rd class and at the southern end a waiting room of 1st and 2nd class. On the street side there was a massive two-storey building with a passageway and service rooms. The surroundings of the railway station were especially designed in a horticultural way and adapted to the park facilities at the number ponds.[4] With the double-track extension of the main line in 1895 and the extension to the junction station by the Nuremberg Ring Railway branches in the direction of Rangierbahnhof (1898) or Mögeldorf / Nürnberg-Ost (1900), as well as the construction of additional freight tracks, the area of the railway station continued to grow.

      <p id="GL410_498_001" num_links="3">In the 1920s, both the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the North Shore Line (an interurban railroad linking Chicago and Milwaukee) existed under the private ownership of Samuel Insull. The North Shore Line's original route to Milwaukee ran through numerous North Shore communities that had become densely settled. In order to provide faster service between Chicago and Milwaukee, the North Shore Line decided to build a high-speed bypass several miles west of its original line. The new route would traverse the Skokie Valley and converge with the 'L' at <link wikipedia="Howard_station" osm="4060906740" type="node">Howard</link>. In an attempt to encourage development in the village of <link wikipedia="Skokie,_Illinois" osm="123452" type="relation">Niles Center</link> on the southern portion of the line, the Chicago Rapid Transit Company would operate rapid transit service as far as <link wikipedia="Dempster–Skokie_station" osm="194785603" type="way">Dempster Street</link>.
