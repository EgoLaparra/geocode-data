The mountain reaches just above the bushline and can be climbed as a day hike without mountaineering equipment but is nevertheless a strenuous and steep climb and a full day should be allowed by the time access to the feet of the ranges is included. Access is gained either from the Wairarapa (eastern) side of the Remutaka Range from the Orongorongo River on the Wellington side of the range. New Zealand archaeologist George Leslie Adkin was a notable climber of Mount Matthews.[1] The species Rhypodes chinai is also native to Mount Matthews.[3]

The mountain vegetation is largely composed of heath around the summit plateau with evergreen forest along the wetter eastern slopes and grassland to the western side. Annual rainfall totals are high (around 2200 mm) but long spells of dry weather occur during the winter period of May to August. Due to its relatively low altitude and tropical location, snow falls very rarely, last recorded in August 1935.[2]

According to Greek mythology, this mountain was sacred to Dionysus and the Dionysian mysteries; it was also sacred to Apollo and the Corycian nymphs, and it was the home of the Muses.  The mountain was also favored by the Dorians. It is suggested that the name derives from parnassas, the possessive adjective of the Luwian word parna meaning house, or specifically temple, so the name effectively means the mountain of the house of the god.[2]

Its altitude is 2,457 meters and its highest peak is Liakouras. To the Northeast it is connected to Giona and to the south with Kirphe. Its name is due to the homonymous hero of the Greek mythology, son of Cleopompus (or Poseidon) and Cleodora, who had built on the mountain a city which was destroyed in the Deluge of Deukalion. Etymological analysis, however, shows a prehellenic origin of the name, relating it to the Pelasgians, and it appears to be from the Anatolian language Luwian.[2]

It is located on the southern extremity of the city between the Yarrowee Creek and the White Horse Range. Physically it is largely cut off from the rest of Ballarat which contributes to a sense of a suburb apart. The traditional Wathaurung country was first invaded in 1836 when the Yuille brothers established a sheep run that included the sheltered corner under the escarpment later named Mount Pleasant. In those days, before there was a town at Ballarat, Buninyong was the nearest township. When the gold rush of 1851 brought thousands of diggers to nearby Golden Point, Mount Pleasant was left alone as no gold was initially found there. Its peacefulness made it attractive to a number of Cornish miners and their families who had come to Australia to settle permanently. These Wesleyans were the founders of the community. As devout and sober church people they sought a  place to live away from the drunken mayhem of the diggings around Main Road.

By 8 August the four-square-kilometre (1.5 sq mi) sized tailings pond had been emptied of the majority of supernatant (process water) that sits atop the settled solids (mining waste, or 'tailings').

Another source gives the quantity spilled as: 7.3 million cubic metres (7.3 billion litres; 1.9 billion US gallons) of tailings, 10.6 million cubic metres (10.6 billion litres; 2.8 billion US gallons) of water, and 6.5 million cubic metres (6.5 billion litres; 1.7 billion US gallons) of interstitial water.[4]
The slurry of tailings and process water carried felled trees, mud and debris and "scoured away the banks" of Hazeltine Creek which flows out of Polley Lake and continued into the nearby <link wikipedia="Quesnel_Lake" osm="2911480" type="relation">Quesnel Lake</link>. The spill caused Polley Lake to rise by 1.5 metres (4.9 ft).[5] Hazeltine Creek was transformed from a two-metre-wide (6.6 ft) stream to a 50-metre-across (160 ft) "wasteland"*[6]  and Cariboo Creek was also affected.[2]
As of 8 August 2014, a "slurry of toxic water and mud" continued to pour into Quesnel Lake.[6] By the end of the day the four-square-kilometre (1.5 sq mi) sized tailings pond was "virtually empty".[2][5]
Mine safety experts and media articles have called the spill one of the biggest environmental disasters in modern Canadian history.[7][8] British Columbia’s government initially insisted the dam failure was not an environmental disaster but stated "We will have a much better idea 24 hours from now on the quality in Quesnel Lake," ,[9] a position clarified again by British Columbia’s Environment Minister, Mary Polak, in November 2014 after more sampling data became available.[10]

Richard Stout opened the first general store in the village around 1822 and in 1830, Josiah Cook and Reuben Savidge opened a second store.[3]  The settlement was also later home to two shoe shops, a dressmaker, wheelwrights, a blacksmith, a harness shop, an agricultural implements warehouse, a post office and a steam sawmill.  In its heyday the community had about 20 houses.  Nathaniel Drake opened an applejack distillery in the village in the mid-19th century.  He made and sold peach brandy, apple cider and apple whiskey.  The Whiskey House (192 Pennington-Rocky Hill Road),[4] the office building for the distillery and the only remaining Drake building in the village, is listed on the township, state and national registers of historic places.  The community's schoolhouse, a stone building east of the crossroads, was later replaced by a frame building on the southern end of the village that is a private residence today.

The fire road route leads almost directly up Blue Ridge to Mount Sizer and is affectionately nicknamed "The Shortcut". This road rises roughly 1,500 feet (457 m) in 1.3 miles (2.1 km) giving it an average grade of 22%.

Mount Stevenson was named in 1871 by geologist Ferdinand Hayden during the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 for his friend and chief assistant, James Stevenson (1840–1888).[2]  Stevenson, who had run away from home as a young boy, first met Hayden in 1853 during an exploration of the Dakota Badlands.  In 1866, Stevenson began working for Hayden and did so until 1879.  Hayden specifically cited Stevenson's loyalty to him in his 1872 report on the 1871 survey of the park.  Stevenson Island on <link wikipedia="Yellowstone_Lake" osm="207316" type="relation">Yellowstone Lake</link> is also named for James Stevenson.
