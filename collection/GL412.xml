      <p id="GL412_001_002" num_links="2">Mount Susitna is often called The Sleeping Lady for its resemblance to a recumbent woman. The name is thought to have originated from a short story written by Nancy Lesh and published in the Alaska Northern Lights magazine in the early 1960s. In the story, a woman named Susitna belonging to a race of giants vows to sleep until her beloved comes back from battle[citation needed]. In "The Sleeping Lady", a children's picture book written by Ann Dixon in 1964, the giant woman fell asleep waiting for her beloved to return from battle, unaware that he had been killed. Dixon and her publisher were sued for their version of the story, but a judge ruled that the story had become a legend, and was therefore uncopyrightable.[2] The mountain's Dena'ina name is Dghelishla, meaning "Little Mountain"; in English it was simply named for the <link wikipedia="Susitna_River" osm="383385801 3461951" type="way relation">Susitna River</link> which means Sandy River.[1]   "Dinglishna" in <link wikipedia="Alaska" osm="474582475 1116270" type="node relation">Alaska</link>, such as in the name of the Dinglishna Hills, Alaska subdivision of Matanuska-Susitna Valley is a similar word which means "Little Ridge that Extends".  This is pointed out on page 113 of the second edition of 
Shem Pete's Alaska 2003. In "A Dena'ina Legacy," Peter Kalifornsky a Dena'ina Athabascan elder tells the story of the Mountain People who gathered at Susitna, and a giant lady who said she would lie down by the river she loved to become Susitna Mountain. Her relatives followed, Kalifornsky said, to become Mount Redoubt, Mount Iliamna and the Chigmit Mountain Range. Another wandered inland to become Denali.

The trail is especially popular with families and older walkers as it provides the easiest and most leisurely access to the peak.

As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.[5] Precipitation runoff from Mount Teneriffe drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River.

[1] The tradition supposedly originated from a boundary dispute between two temples, <link wikipedia="Tōdai-ji" osm="251381458" type="node">Tōdai-ji</link> and <link wikipedia="Kōfuku-ji" osm="251381462 98093576" type="node way">Kōfuku-ji</link> in 1760. As the mediations failed, the entire mountain was set ablaze. Other explanations suggest the extermination of wild boars or pests as a result. The festival today begins with a ceremonial igniting by members of both temples, followed by a fireworks display. The festival has been postponed due to poor weather in the past.

The latest known casualty was an orang asli who got mauled to death by a Malayan tiger. There are also the usual leeches and sand flies that populate the entire mountain. The mountain trail is deemed tough as there are fallen tree trunks, sharp-edged bamboos and thorny trees that poses a lot of challenge for hikers to get to the mountain's peak. The conical shape of the mountain means having to go up an extremely steep slope to the summit. This mountain is definitely not recommended for people inexperienced at climbingmountains in the tropical rainforest.

The apartments scale the diagonally sloping roof of the parking garage, from street level to 11th floor, creating an artificial, south facing 'mountainside'. Each apartment has a "backyard" on the roof of the property in front and below it. The resulting courtyard penthouses are an attempt to balance "the splendours of the suburban backyard with the intensity of an urban lifestyle".[1] Throughout the building, it plays on a mountain metaphor as well as the clash between the urban vibe of the interior parking space as well as the surroundings and the peaceful and organic hillside.

Mountain Pointe was completed by the fall of 1990, but the Tempe Union district could not open it right away due to funding shortfalls.[4] At last, the new, US$27 million facility ($50.7 million in 2019 dollars[5]) opened to students the next year.[4] The 1,100 students in grades 9 and 10 that attended the school at its start were asked to pick a mascot: an eagle, thunder, rough riders or a pride of lions, which won out.[6] Its rival <link wikipedia="Desert_Vista_High_School" osm="200291953" type="way">Desert Vista High School</link> was opened to serve the growing southwestern part of Ahwatukee in 1996.

When Mountain View Cemetery opened in 1886, it supplanted burial grounds in what was designated <link wikipedia="Stanley_Park" osm="3710701589 37063023" type="node way">Stanley Park</link> that same year as the city's cemetery. The original parcel of land now known as the "Old Section" is bounded by Fraser Street on the east, 37th Avenue on the south, 33rd on the north, and three remaining trees from what was once a row of tall Lawson Cypress trees on the west. Land on the north of this was purchased in 1901 for an expansion and became the "Horne I Addition" – named after the developer who sold the land. The Jones farm between 37th and 41st Avenues was added in 1910 as the Jones I and Jones II Additions, and in 1922, an additional piece was acquired west of the Horne I Addition. The "1919 Addition" is a tract bounded by 41st and 43rd Avenues, and contains many victims of the Spanish flu pandemic that took many hundreds of lives of local residents.  The final addition is the Abray Park Addition on the western side, acquired in 1941 through a land swap with the Vancouver Park Board and was named after a squatter, Nonus Abray, who previously lived on the land and tended an orchard and grazed cattle there.  Burial sites historically were often grouped together along the lines of religion (e.g., Jewish), nationality (e.g., <link wikipedia="China" osm="424313582 270056" type="node relation">Chinese</link> and <link wikipedia="Japan" osm="424313451 382313" type="node relation">Japanese</link>), or organizational affiliation (e.g., Freemasons and Oddfellows).
