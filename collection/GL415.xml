A two-story sandstone addition was added onto the original brick structure to serve as a kitchen and second floor bedroom.

It was begun in 1868, dedicated in 1872, and is one story rectangular stone structure with a two bay facade and a tower. The tower features a steep gable roof with flared eaves and a louvered belfry. Architects Dixon and Davis of Baltimore designed this stone building in the Gothic Revival style. The Wilmington Daily Commercial publicized its construction, describing blue granite and brownstone mined from Chestnut Hill, a steeple soaring 100 feet high and twenty-foot interior ceilings. A large, pointed-arch, stained-glass window dominates the north wall facing Main Street. Narrow, pointed-arch windows with pastel, diamond-shaped panes line the east and west walls between exterior stone buttresses. The slate roof has alternating rows of square and scalloped shingles. In 1967, the building was sold by the First Presbyterian Church to the <link wikipedia="University_of_Delaware" osm="2768377929" type="node">University of Delaware</link>. The University of Delaware renamed it after J. Fenton Daugherty, professor of physics from 1929 to 1945 and dean of men from 1945 to 1951. Several generations of students knew it as "The Abbey," a cafeteria-style dining facility. In 1995, as part of the new student center project, the University restored the sanctuary and reopened it as a "quiet" study lounge adjoining Trabant University Center.

      <p id="GL415_185_002" num_links="5">In the 18th century, the nascent Georgetown College, with only one building on its campus in the <link wikipedia="Georgetown_(Washington,_D.C.)" osm="4639452" type="relation">Georgetown</link> neighborhood of Washington, D.C., was in continual need of additional space. Therefore, in 1792, with all of the college's facilities housed within the South Building (which was demolished in 1904), land was purchased for the construction of an additional building. Construction started in 1794[1] on what became known as the North Building, and work on its edifice was completed by 1795. The architect is believed to have been Leonard Harbaugh, the <link wikipedia="Baltimore" osm="671113 154196553 133345" type="node node relation">Baltimore</link>-based designer of <link wikipedia="Holy_Trinity_Catholic_Church_(Washington,_D.C.)" osm="66346520" type="way">Holy Trinity Chapel</link>.[1] The building was modeled after <link wikipedia="Nassau_Hall" osm="27341267" type="way">Nassau Hall</link> at Princeton University. Funding the construction of a building of its size was difficult for the school. The total cost of its initial construction exceeded £10,000, a sum significantly greater than the revenue from the Jesuits' <link wikipedia="Maryland" osm="316964668 162112" type="node relation">Maryland</link> plantations, which were funding the project. The board of directors was required to raise tuition, cut President Robert Plunkett's salary by more than half,[1] and make some payments in the form of cows raised on campus as barter, rather than in cash. The interior of the building was not complete until 1809, with an anonymous contribution of $400. Upon completion, the 154-foot-long building increased the amount of dormitory space on campus fourfold. It also housed classrooms, a refectory,[5] and a chapel.[2] The building finally opened for use in 1797.[1]

Bowen Co. (one of the founders of the present day Welles-Bowen Realty Company) who is credited with selecting the Old Orchard name. Accounts tell of a large apple orchard near the corner of Densmore and Bancroft and a peach orchard near Pemberton and Middlesex. Mr. Bowen is also credited with selecting the English-sounding street names, although no information exists as to why. One potential explanation is that Mr. Bowen had also developed the Westmoreland neighborhood (about 1 mile east of Old Orchard) around 1917 and selected those street names from areas in <link wikipedia="Virginia" osm="317004702 224042" type="node relation">Virginia</link> (<link wikipedia="Mount_Vernon" osm="232724526" type="way">Mount Vernon</link>, <link wikipedia="Richmond,_Virginia" osm="2592301390 3864712" type="node relation">Richmond</link>, Potomac), as the rolling terrain reminded him of that part of the country.

The church is also known as the Norwegian: Rosekyrkja or "Rose Church" because the interior walls and ceilings are painted with rosemaling, a decorative style of painting that is common in Norway. It is one of the most decorated churches in Norway.[3] Wood materials from the stave church was probably reused, such as in the roof of the vestibule and the four large columns. There is a crucifix (13th century) and a baptismal font from the older church. The stave church was likely rose painted inside too.[4]

The school was founded in 1851 by the Sisters of St. Francis in Oldenburg.  Mother Teresa Hackelmeier began the school, educating girls from the surrounding community.  With a rough winter, the Sisters found the need to house students, and thus boarding began at Oldenburg Academy.  By 1986, the enrollment was up to 117.  Oldenburg Academy received its commission as a high school in 1910.  In the 1940s, great changes occurred:  the school moved to being a high school only and moved away from the elementary level.  Later, the Sisters relinquished control of the Academy and in 1994, Oldenburg Academy incorporated and began control by a Board of Trustees.  The boarding program ended at the end of the 1998-1999 school year.  And young men were admitted beginning in the fall of 2000.  The Alma Mater inspires students to "virtue, honor, and education."
