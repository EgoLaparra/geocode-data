In addition, Immerhof protected other Maginot works in the vicinity: the casemates of Kanfen, the infantry shelter of Stressling, the observation point and shelter of Hettange-Grande, and a number of nearby blockhouses constructed during the Phoney War.

By the 1970s the plan had lost favour and funding, and Schoenenboug was abandoned.  In 1987 a local organisation undertook Schoenenbourg's preservation, and today it is open to public visitation.

The Americans briefly occupied the fort in the first days of 1945 until the German counter-offence of Operation Nordwind, which allowed them to take back control of the Simserhof. The fort was finally liberated by the 100th Infantry Division on March 15th 1945. Following the war, it was initially repaired for the French Army and later converted into a Maginot Line museum in the early 1960s.
