In the beginning it was called People`s Provincial Theatre and it was placed in the “Partizan” sport center.  This object had a very small stage and did not fulfill the basic requirements for a place which could be used as a theatre. The founders of the first professional theatre in Kosovo were Pavle Vugrinac, Milan and Cica Petrovic who gathered young talented actors willing to work for the theatre and named Shefqet Musliu as their general director.  After the staff was completed with 14 art enthusiasts who delivered two premiers, People`s Provincial Theatre was officially established on October 7, 1945.[2] The first official show released by this theatre was called “The sugar ball” (Albanian: Topi i sheqerit”) from the author Glishiq which was followed by 16 other successful premiers and two tours across Kosovo.
In 1946, the theatre was moved to <link wikipedia="Pristina" osm="2885136501 7118787" type="node relation">Pristina</link>, where there was a work interruption due to construction of a new theatre facility, meanwhile the young actors working for the theatre spread to search for a job in another active theatre.

There were many new actors who joined the theatre, but in the absence of professional directors, two of them (Abdurrahman Shala and Muharrem Qena) were trained under the supervision of Dobrica Radenkovic and were turned into successful and famous theatre directors and stage managers.[5] During the following years the theatre had very capable general directors such as Azem Shkreli and Ramiz Kelmendi, who developed theatre activity in <link wikipedia="Kosovo" osm="4366234392 2088990" type="node relation">Kosovo</link> and made the theatre a very important art institution. In the 90s follow the violent Serbian occupation measures in Kosovo, which affected theatrical activity as well. Right after the war, the name of this theatre was changed from Peoples Provincial Theatre to National Theatre of Kosovo.[6]

The Central Illinois office initially consisted of two forecast offices in <link wikipedia="Peoria,_Illinois" osm="153745868 126009" type="node relation">Peoria</link> and <link wikipedia="Springfield,_Illinois" osm="5518531014 126326" type="node relation">Springfield</link> until the current location in <link wikipedia="Lincoln,_Illinois" osm="153414714 126206" type="node relation">Lincoln</link> became the sole local forecast office in 1995. Federal meteorology offices and stations in the region date back to the 19th century when the Army Signal Service began taking weather observations using weather equipment at the Springer Building in <link wikipedia="Springfield,_Illinois" osm="5518531014 126326" type="node relation">Springfield</link>. Since that time the presence of the National Weather Service greatly increased with the installation of new weather radars, stations and forecast offices. The current office in Lincoln maintains a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar system, and Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly improve forecasting in the region. Lincoln is in charge  of weather forecasts, warnings and local statements as well as aviation weather.

It is the largest Orthodox cathedral in the Baltic provinces built with the blessing of the Russian Tsar Alexander II  on the initiative of local governor-general Pyotr Bagration  and bishop Veniamin Karelin. The Nativity of Christ Cathedral is renowned for its icons, some of which were painted by Vasili Vereshchagin. During the First World War German troops occupied Riga and turned its largest Russian Orthodox cathedral into a Lutheran church. In independent Latvia, the Nativity of Christ Cathedral once again became an Orthodox cathedral in 1921. Archbishop Jānis Pommers, a native Latvian, played a key part in the defence of the cathedral, including defence from the Latvian government which was extremely unfriendly to Orthodox Church in the first years of an independent Latvia. In the early 1960s, Soviet authorities closed down the cathedral and converted its building into a planetarium. The cathedral has been restored since Latvia regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

      <p id="GL425_181_001" num_links="2">The present Natural Science Museum of Valencia has its origin in the Palaeontological Municipal Museum, established in 1889 in the lost San Gregorio's Convent located in San Vicente Street in the current Olympia Theatre. [1]
This museum was created thanks to the engineer José Rodrigo Bolet, who generously donated his private collection. He was born in <link wikipedia="Manises" osm="1470838506 347614" type="node relation">Manises</link> in 1842, but emigrated to Argentina in 1875, where he led civil engineering projects and took part in hydraulic works in Brazil, The Andes and Patagonia. Besides that, he was involved in the design and planning of <link wikipedia="La_Plata" osm="247782633 3266014" type="node relation">La Plata</link> city and the port of La Campana, which he also built. On July 14th, 1889, he left Argentina with his enormous paleontological collection aboard the ship Mateo Bruzzo, arriving at the port of Barcelona in the midst of great expectation. A special train was chartered to transport the valuable collection to Valencia, arriving the evening of August 9th.[1]
The collection is made up of a large number of mammal fossils belonging to the South American Quaternary, including a human skeleton called Samborombón considered to be the star of the collection. It was the focus of a great amount of scientific discussions in the early 20th century due to the postulate of the tertiary antiquity of the origin of mankind.[1] 
He was accompanied by Enrique De Carles, the main fossil collector and naturalist technician of the Museum of Buenos Aires. He was the main person in charge of the mounting of the skeletons until his early leaving in June 1890, when the city of Valencia suffered the last cholera outbreak.[1] 
It was this year when the collection was moved from the San Gregorio's Convent to a municipal property located at number 62 of Ruzafa Street, where it remained temporarily until 1896. The collection was placed in an old Jesuit building, the San Pablo's Hospital, next to the Alquería de Julià, far from the historical centre.[1]

According to tradition it was one of the great royal sites of pre-Christian Gaelic Ireland and the capital of the Ulaidh. It is a large circular hilltop enclosure—marked by a bank and ditch—inside which is a circular mound and the remains of a ring barrow. Archeological investigations show that there were once buildings on the site, including a huge roundhouse-like structure which has been likened to a temple. In a ritual act, this timber structure was filled with stones, deliberately burnt down and then covered with earth to create the mound which stands today. It is believed that Navan was a pagan ceremonial site and was regarded as a sacred space. It features prominently in Irish mythology, especially in the tales of the Ulster Cycle. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Celtic Mythology, "the [Eamhain Mhacha] of myth and legend is a far grander and mysterious place than archeological excavation supports".[1]

For many years the town had a grocery store and gas station, which has been used for several businesses off-and-on since. The population was 35 in 2000, though a few nearby subdivided communities of Denton have sprung up as the area between Denton and McKinney, Texas continues to grow in population.[1] The community of Paloma Creek[2] sits on what used to be considered Navo (which technically no longer exists).
