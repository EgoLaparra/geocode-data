Operation in the reverse direction also occurred. Due to street restrictions below, which limited the right-of-way width above, platforms were on the outside of the four track right-of-way, making a cross-platform interchange impossible. To accommodate this, the platforms were made exceptionally long so that non-rush hour length multiple unit (MU) trains could stack end-to-end and allow passengers to transfer. A set of crossovers from the outside tracks to the inner tracks were at the east end of the station, to permit trains stopping at Ozone Park to run express after the station stop, or to perform the reverse move.

The entrance to the cloister area contains murals related to the early evangelization efforts of this order. They include scenes such as Hernán Cortés greeting the first Franciscan missionaries in Mexico, the martyrdom of some of the first young converts to Christianity and even a scene where the monks are flogging Cortés.[2] The church itself inside has suffered the theft of a number of its antique pieces.[3] The name Ozumba comes from Nahuatl meaning “over the streams of water”. “de Alzate” was added to the formal name  in honor of the scientist José Antonio Alzate y Ramirez Santillana who was born here.[1]

(According to Comecon decisions, Polish industry was responsible for developing agricultural aircraft). There were several agricultural plane designs proposed in the early 1960s by a group of young designers from WSK PZL Warszawa-Okęcie, led by Andrzej Frydrychewicz. These proposals were made on their own initiative, but  never realized because the USSR was content with the An-2 and was planning to replace it with a jet aircraft (later <link wikipedia="PZL_M-15_Belphegor" osm="4785791894" type="node">PZL M-15 Belphegor</link>). The first was the PZL-101M Kruk 63 of 1963. That remained a paper aeroplane, but did give its name to later designs. Next were the PZL-106 Kruk 65 (1965), PZL-110 Kruk-2T (1969) and PZL M-14 Kruk (1970, it was planned to produce this variant in <link wikipedia="PZL_Mielec" osm="9341717" type="relation">PZL-Mielec</link>). Only in 1971 did the authorities decide to start development of the new agricultural design as the PZL-106 Kruk 71. Despite this decision, its development was quite protracted, due to both economic and political reasons. The work, led by Andrzej Frydrychewicz, started in 1972, and was based on earlier designs. The first prototype was flown on April 17, 1973. The designers chose a safe layout of a braced low-wing monoplane with a container for chemicals in front of the pilot, and was inspired by planes like Piper PA-25 Pawnee (in case of an emergency landing, the container would not crush the higher sitting pilot).

PZL-Mielec asked for Rockwell's help because of the political situation at the time: operating in an Eastern Bloc country, PZL wanted the aircraft to sell well worldwide, and the company realized that certification by the United States Federal Aviation Administration would be important in reaching that goal. Rockwell on the other hand wanted to fit Polish high-power radial engines into its agricultural planes. As a result of this cooperation the Rockwell Thrush Commander aircraft was fitted with the PZL-3 engine, and the Polish designers created the higher payload M-18 Dromader by introducing the more powerful ASz-62 engine, making structural changes to the airframe, and increasing dimensions. This co-operation meant that the Dromader shares outer wing panels and part of a fuselage with the Thrush Commander.

In 1990 the Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Illinois bought 116 acres (47 ha) of land adjacent to the Port of Redwood City and Westpoint Slough and formed the Pacific Shores Center Partnership to develop it.[2][3]
After many years of planning Redwood City and the partnership had a complete development agreement with plans for a land swap, that decreased the total property to 106 acres (43 ha), and public shore space to allow for public use of parts of the property.[4]
In November 1999 Jay Paul Company entered into an agreement to buy the rights for the project by outbidding several other competing developers with a US$90,000,000 bid.[5]
By early 2000 with the buildings not even complete; Excite@Home, Phone.com, Informatica Corp, and BroadVision Inc. had all signed leases. Demand at the time caused rent prices to increase for the center as well.[6]

Until 1947, the pastor was the head of the college's religion department. The congregation moved into its own new building in 1968. Like most churches of the time, its practices were traditional in form with weekly performances by its church choir.[3] By 1984, the church plant was worth an estimated $7.7 million due to inflation, it had cost less than a third of that amount to construct in 1968.[4] When Healdsburg College, now PUC, was first established, the College operated all levels of the educational experience.[5] However, starting in 1901, the College Church took over the financial responsibility for the elementary school.[5] They raised a church-school fund. All the children of the church were free to attend the school.[5] In 2000, PUC Church was noted for being the only church in the Northern California Conference of Seventh-day Adventists to have a female pastor.[6] Pastors from the church have been featured at various events hosted by Adventist Churches.[7] The church is active in philanthropy. In 2010 the church raised over $25,000 to aid in relief efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[8] The church has 1,800 members, not including the 1,500 students attending Pacific Union College.[9][10] Theologian Desmond Ford continued to hold membership at the church after being defrocked.  Many years later, in 2001, he voluntarily requested to have his name dropped from membership for reasons which seem to be unrelated to his defrocking.[11][12]

The 17-mile (27 km) loop trail can be hiked as a 10-mile (16 km) stretch (north section) or the 7.5-mile (12.1 km) south section. The trails are rugged and can be challenging for the inexperienced or unprepared hiker. Horseback riding is also common on the Piney Creek Trail. 
The Paddy Creek Recreation Area is nearby, and offers many camping amenities. There are many single sites, and a few double sites available. There is also fishing access on the Big Piney River, via a trail access from the campground.
