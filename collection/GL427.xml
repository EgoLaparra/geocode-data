Together they formed the Finca
Güell, an extensive parcel of land (30,000 m2). The Can Feliu building was remodeled by the architect Joan Martorell i Montells, who built a Caribbean-style small palace, together with a Gothic Revival-style chapel and surrounded by magnificent gardens. Later the building remodeling was given to Antoni Gaudí in 1887, together with the construction of a surrounding perimeter wall and the side entry pavilions.
Gaudí also partially designed the gardens surrounding the palace, placing two fountains and a pergola and planted many Mediterranean plants like palm trees, cypress trees, magnolias, pine trees and <link wikipedia="Eucalyptus" osm="6440698167 6443362022" type="node node">eucalyptus</link>.

The ground floor is finished in rusticated bugnato ashlar, the first floor, separated from the second with bas-reliefs of heraldic symbols, has windows crowned with garlands and decorative mouldings. Some of the rooms still have period decorations, the most famous of which is the gallery decorated with frescoes by Martin Knoller and stuccos by Giocondo Albertolli.

Both have light plaster walls, recently restored. The two buildings had separate histories until they were combined into a hotel in the late 19th century.

On the opposite façade of this palace, opening onto the Piazzetta dei Massimo, the palace connects with the frescoed façade of the conjoined annex, the Palazzetto Massimi (or Palazzetto Istoriato). For many centuries, this used to be the central post office of Rome, a Massimo family perquisite. To the left of the palace is the Palazzo di Pirro, built by a pupil of Antonio da Sangallo.

It was built by the Borghese family on the Quirinal Hill; its footprint occupies the site where the ruins of the baths of Constantine stood, whose remains still are part of the basement of the main building, the Casino dell'Aurora. Its first inhabitant was the famed art collector Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the nephew of Pope Paul V, who wanted to be housed near the large papal <link wikipedia="Quirinal_Palace" osm="2707110" type="relation">Palazzo Quirinale</link>. The palace and garden of the Pallavicini-Rospigliosi were the product of the accumulated sites and were designed by Giovanni Vasanzio and Carlo Maderno in 1611–16. Scipione owned this site for less than a decade, 1610–16, and commissioned the construction and decoration of the casino and pergolata, facing the garden of Montecavallo.

On the walls are four frescoes of the Seasons by Paul Bril, and two Triumphs by Antonio Tempesta. Its ceiling displays what is considered the Bolognese painter Guido Reni's fresco masterpiece (1614), commonly called L'Aurora.[1] It is surrounded by a painted frame or quadro riportato and depicts Apollo in his Chariot preceded by Dawn (Aurora) bringing light to the world. The incorporated heraldic symbols were meant to link Scipione with Apollo. The work is classically restrained and mimics poses from ancient Roman sarcophagi, many of which are part of the museum's collection. The chariot procession, which recalls the Annibale Carracci paintings in the Farnese Gallery in the <link wikipedia="Palazzo_Farnese" osm="22289" type="relation">Farnese Palace</link>, shows even more restraint. There is little concession to perspective, and if anything the vibrantly colored style is an affront to the tenebrism of Caravaggio's followers, despite this being a pavilion commissioned by one of Caravaggio's early patrons, Scipione Borghese. The pergolata is decorated by Paul Bril.

Projected to receive the surplus of water, the lake is connected to the small Vraničina river by the drainage tunnel. The reservoir was mostly kept almost empty, so that it would be ready to receive the water and in the next 25 years there was never an overspill of the water over the dam, as the drainage tunnel was always operational. In 2008, RB Kolubara, which administered the reservoir handed over the care over it to the local fishing association from <link wikipedia="Valjevo" osm="307649772" type="node">Valjevo</link>, "Eko Ribarstvo". In order to enhance the fish production, they filled the reservoir, removed some of the equipment while the rest rusted in time, closed the sluice gates and welded the drainage hatchets.[2][3]
