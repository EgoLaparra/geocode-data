The rail bridge is, for the most part, a conventional bridge resting on concrete piers, but has a double-leaf bascule section midway, which can be raised to let ships and barges pass through. Until 1988, the Pamban bridge was the only surface transport that connected Tamil Nadu's island of <link wikipedia="Rameswaram" osm="339884241" type="node">Rameswaram</link> to the mainland. In Dec-2018, the bascule of this bridge was damaged, which suspended the transportation on the bridge for 3 months. Rail movement was again restored on 27th Feb 2019.

Pflueger had designed the library with the intent that Rivera's mural would cover three walls;[3] the mural as-completed would be mounted on the south wall of the library's reading room, and Rivera intended to return once the library was complete to add murals to the west and east walls.[4] Both the San Francisco Art Commission and Board of Education received protests over the mural's content before its completion, primarily because of the included caricatures of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. The Art Commission approved the artistic merit in August 1940 but deferred the judgement of appropriate subject matter to the Board of Education.[5] Pflueger announced that Rivera would continue to work on the mural for "at least another week" after the close of GGIE.[6]

Many years later, after the restoration of images, the inhabitants of the area saw a strange light shining from this point on the mountain. They found the icon and built a monastery immediately below in the name of the Virgin and the wormwood bush. The monastery was known in western medieval sources as the Abbey of Abscithi or Apinthi.[1] Sometimes it was simply called Psithia, as in the Chronicle of George Boustronios.[2]

However, with the end of the Salt trade in the 1950s and the construction of the Arniko Highway in the 1960s bypassing this old town, Panauti has gone into an economic rut.[2] Panauti, consists of a variety of Buddhist and Hindu religious monuments, and is considered to be one of the area's most important medieval sites.[3]
Panauti is also steeped in culture and tradition. Visitors will often find colorful stones, petals and other items that are laid out on the pavement to welcome everyone with great hospitality.[4]

Part of a run-of-the-river power scheme, it diverts the waters of the Beas to the southwest through a  38 km (24 mi) long system of tunnels and channels. The water is used for power generation at the Dehar Power House before being discharged into the <link wikipedia="Sutlej" osm="44379049 325142" type="way relation">Sutlej River</link>, connecting both rivers.

The initial hill fort of the Teutonic Knights (erected 1343) was replaced by a castle built in 1604-1610 by a noble Hungarian descent Janusz Eperjesz. The name “Panemunė“ („along the Nemunas“, pronounced Pa ne mu‘ ne), it is guessed, arose from the former Panemunė Manor that was once here. Panemunė Castle was not designed to be a stronghold for the defence of the land but a typical, for the beginning of the 17th mentury, nobleman castle with defensive fittings, residential buildings, and farm buildings. Panemunė Castle became one of the most beautiful Renaissance era building in Lithuania. The castle was reconstructed around 1759 by Giełgud family. The new owners established lawish manor house like interiors with frescos, which has been recently discovered, while remaining wings of the castle is still under restoration. 
At present the castle is prepared for visitors. The castle stands in a park on a high hill and is surrounded by five cascading ponds. During a tourism season, works of Vilnius Art Academy are exhibited in the castle. It is possible to walk inside the castle, and admire the wonderful view that open from the castle tower.
