The bridge, described using its historic name, Raritan Bridge, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 12, 1992 for its engineering and method of construction.[5]

      <p id="GL429_272_002" num_links="2">The site was opened as The New Forest Butterfly Farm in 1981, and the main glasshouse complex that formed the farm still stands today. That venture was closed in the early 1990s, and it was taken over by entertainment company Vardon Plc. (which also owned the UK's numerous <link wikipedia="Sea_Life" osm="28399518" type="way">Sea Life Centres</link>), who turned the site into New Forest Nature Quest, a collection specialising in native wildlife. However, when Vardon was taken over by <link wikipedia="Merlin_Entertainments" osm="356129913" type="way">Merlin Entertainments</link> in 1998, the park was put up for sale. Some of the animal collection was taken over by a company called 'Nature Quest' owned by Kenneth West, that eventually was housed at the newly created Wildwood Discovery Park in Kent. The remainder of the collection was taken over by Roger Heap who had already been running the Chestnut Centre, an otter and owl specialised collection in Derbyshire, since 1984 when he took over ownership of the park. Along with the many native animals that Nature Quest had fixed into the park, the Heap family added a large collection of otters and owls on par with the Derbyshire Park and The New Forest Otter, Owl and Wildlife Conservation Park was born. Twelve years later, the park was re-branded as The New Forest Wildlife Park to emphasise the large and expanding collection of native and past-native wildlife in addition to the many otters and owls.

In its early years the 20,000-acre (8,100 ha) settlement was the home of Lutherans who had separated from the official church in the Duchy of Württemberg and immigrated to the United States.[7] The Harmonists built a new town in the wilderness, but in 1824 they decided to sell their property and return to <link wikipedia="Pennsylvania" osm="316987717 162109" type="node relation">Pennsylvania</link>.[8] Robert Owen, a <link wikipedia="Wales" osm="58437" type="relation">Welsh</link> industrialist and social reformer, purchased the town in 1825 with the intention of creating a new utopian community and renamed it New Harmony.

The 1870-built station was located along the eastbound tracks with an open wooden shelter shed along the westbound tracks. This station contained elaborate gingerbread woodwork, similar to that of Yaphank station during the same period.[5] In 1947, the station house was rebuilt again with a smaller and less elaborate brick structure, and relocated along the westbound tracks, with a matching brick open shelter along the eastbound tracks. Sometime during the 1960s, high-level platforms were added to the station, with a white stucco wall between the platforms and station house containing a blue sign with white lettering reading "LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD" on top and "NEW HYDE PARK VILLAGE" on the bottom.[6] This was replaced between 2002 and 2003 with the retro-classic structure seen today.[7]
