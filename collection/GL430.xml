(Note that Old Point Comfort and New Point Comfort are two different locations, not two different lights on the same spot.) Burroughs's involvement with New Point Comfort, however, extended beyond construction. New Point Comfort at the time was a small island separated from the mainline by a narrow passage named Deep Creek. A dispute with the owner of the island over the portion needed for the light led first to an additional appropriation; but then Burroughs bought the entire island and sold the government the few acres needed for the light. His decision to subcontract out the construction of the keeper's house proved unwise, and the subcontractor took sick and was unable to supervise the firing of the bricks for the house, which were thus ruined. In the end, Burroughs was appointed keeper himself, a position he held for ten years.

A further resettlement of Central Kalahari residents took place in 2002.

The route serves as the main street of Wellsburg in both function and name. There is no corresponding signed state route on the Pennsylvania side of the border; instead, the road becomes State Route 4013 (SR 4013), one of Pennsylvania's unsigned quadrant routes. NY 367 originally extended north to Lowman when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It was truncated to its current length in 1949.

When dredging techniques made the Clyde navigable as far as Glasgow the port became a shipbuilding centre, and the castle was surrounded by shipyards. Ferguson Shipbuilders, the last shipyard on the lower Clyde, stands close to the west of the castle, but the shipyards to the east were removed around the 1980s and new landscaped areas formed to the east of Newark Castle, opening up scenic views of the castle and across the Clyde from a new bypass road.

"Newark is equally fashionable in terms of its precocious classicism," observes Nicholas Cooper, who points out its rigorously symmetrical front (illustration), unprecedented in the main body of any great house in its time, and the correct Tuscan order of its original main door.[4] The house was then called "New Work"[2] and was partly constructed with building materials from the recently dissolved Kingswood Abbey,[3] some five miles away. The lodge was three bays wide and of single-pile construction, one room deep. In the basement was a kitchen, there were two reception rooms on the ground floor and a banqueting room on the first.[5] Modest sleeping quarters were provided on the third floor, and the roof was flat so that it could be used as a pleasurable lookout over the surrounding countryside,[2] in which it enjoys a commanding position. It was built at about the same time as nearby <link wikipedia="Siston" osm="21374718" type="node">Siston Court</link> was being built by Sir Maurice Denys (d.1563), first cousin of Poyntz's wife Jane Berkeley.

It was named after the Newberry Library that once operated at its location. The complex was completed in 1974 and has 57 floors above ground. Gordon and Levin designed the building, which is the 56th tallest in Chicago. When Newberry Plaza was completed it was the sixth-tallest all-residential skyscraper in the world and the first highrise in the city to have townhomes built on top of a building's pedestal, known as the Skyhomes. The property also contains commercial space under the condominium tower as well as four restaurants including the original location of Morton's The Steakhouse.  Former famous businesses include the opulent restaurant Arnie’s and nightclub Zorine’s, also owned by the Morton family.  In addition to its astonishing views of the city, it might be best known for its prominent location as the only residential high-rise building in a well known triangle of high end restaurants on the east and Oak Street on the south side.
