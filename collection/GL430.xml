      <p id="GL430_382_001" num_links="6">Park Road Shopping Center opened up on November 15, 1956 and was Charlotte's very first open area-type shopping mall.  Developed by A.V. Blankenship, it is typical of Mid-Century modern architecture and the  original billboard sign remains today.  When  the mall was first envisioned, it was considered to be a shift in area business development.  At this time period most of the shopping areas were still  located in and around downtown Charlotte.  Meanwhile, more and more people continued to move to the suburbs and outlying areas of the city.[1]  This has been the catalyst that has kept the shopping center successful to this day.  Park Road Shopping Center is a very bustling mall and serves many of the surrounding Charlotte neighborhoods such as <link wikipedia="Myers_Park_(Charlotte)" osm="154038238" type="node">Myers Park</link>, Barclay Downs, Parkdale, Colonial Village, Madison Park, <link wikipedia="Sedgefield_(Charlotte_neighborhood)" osm="153974353" type="node">Sedgefield</link>, Ashbrook, and <link wikipedia="Starmount_(Charlotte_neighborhood)" osm="153837371" type="node">Starmount</link>.   In 1967 a local attorney named Porter Byrum bought Park Road Shopping  Center.  On June 16, 2011 Mr. Byrum announced that Park Road Shopping Center would be donated to 3 local colleges (<link wikipedia="Queens_University_of_Charlotte" osm="206288382" type="way">Queens University of Charlotte</link>, <link wikipedia="Wingate_University" osm="8369265" type="relation">Wingate University</link>, and <link wikipedia="Wake_Forest_University" osm="357788427" type="node">Wake Forest University</link>).[2]   Mr. Byrum had held  ownership of the shopping center for nearly 44 years.  Just one month later these 3 colleges sold the shopping center for $82 million to EDENS, a   shopping center operator and developer.[3] Despite these sudden changes in ownership, it is expected that the shopping center will continue on as is.  It is easy to walk or bike to the Park Road Shopping Center since it lies on the Little Sugar Creek Greenway.  In 2014 the center underwent a renovation. It was painted white, given wooden features, outdoor seating was added and the covered walkways got new lighting and floor treatment.

It was originally named The Woodlands and Mitchell-Withers created the house as a Gothic fantasy with carved human heads looking out from the eaves and the front door. The dining room was panelled with <link wikipedia="Oak" osm="5550827007 6521030135 6521479335 6521565360" type="node node node node">oak</link> taken from the long gallery of <link wikipedia="Sheffield_Manor_Lodge" osm="3090802190" type="node">Sheffield Manor</link>. The grounds were landscaped with many trees and included kitchen gardens, orchards, stables, a carriage house and harness room. Withers-Mitchell lived at The Woodlands with his wife Lise and by 1871 they had three children, the oldest of which, John, would also become a well-regarded architect like his father. John Mitchell-Withers senior died at the young age of 56 in 1894 and in June 1898 The Woodlands was sold to Sir Robert Hadfield, the metallurgist and owner of the vast Hadfields steel foundry in the east end of Sheffield.

Development of the subdivision (initially called "Fairhaven II" after the neighbouring community to the east, began in the early 1980s. The extreme west end of the neighbourhood remained undeveloped until the subsequent creation of the adjacent Blairmore Suburban Centre led to the final phase of Parkridge being built out in the early 2010s. Whereas the majority of residents are employed in the sales and service sector, the next highest employer is business, finance and administration.  The two main age groups are those in their 40s and teenagers as of 2005.[1]  Until recently Parkridge was the farthest western neighbourhood of Saskatoon south of 22nd Street.  However, new construction will soon see Neighbourhood 2 of the Blairmore SDA bear that claim to fame.[2]  In comparison, the neighbourhood of Parkridge with a 2001 census population of 4,505[1] is larger than the Saskatchewan city of <link wikipedia="Melville,_Saskatchewan" osm="4483030699" type="node">Melville</link> which had a population of  4,149 in 2006, and 4,453 in 2001 and Parkridge is a little smaller than the provincial city of <link wikipedia="Humboldt,_Saskatchewan" osm="52289898" type="node">Humboldt</link> which was 4,998 in 2006, and  5,161 in 2001.[3]  In Saskatchewan rural towns must maintain a population above 5,000 to apply for city status.
