But hostilities during the French and Indian War prevented its settlement. Because a first town meeting was not held within the required five years, the charter was deemed null and void. So Wentworth issued an entirely new charter on November 3, 1761 as New Fane. The town was settled in 1766 by families from <link wikipedia="Worcester_County,_Massachusetts" osm="1838805" type="relation">Worcester County</link>, <link wikipedia="Massachusetts" osm="316965734 61315" type="node relation">Massachusetts</link>.[5] Newfane became the shire town of the county before 1812. Atop Newfane Hill, they built a village, including the county buildings. Because of winter travel difficulties, however, it was relocated to the flatland below in 1825, until 1882 called Fayetteville after the Marquis de Lafayette.[6]

As originally established, Newport County consisted of four towns: Portsmouth, Newport, Jamestown, and New Shoreham. In 1746-47, two towns, Little Compton and Tiverton, were acquired from <link wikipedia="Massachusetts" osm="316965734 61315" type="node relation">Massachusetts</link>.

In 1963, the town of New Shoreham was transferred to Washington County. County government was abolished in Rhode Island in 1842 and today remains only for the purpose of delineating judicial administrative boundaries.

Thirty-four farm families were displaced from the main site, along with those living at the auxiliary sites.  Construction was rapid given the emergency wartime conditions and within three months the post was to be in full operation. The airfield consisted of four concrete runways 4907x150(N/S), 5004x150(NE/SW), 5000x150(E/W), 5000x150(NW/SE), plus associated taxiways, landing aids, and an extended length parking apron.

The current house was built by Edward Rice in the Jacobean style in 1660, though extensive changes were made in the 1850s in the Venetian Gothic style. The house played a role in the Rebecca Riots of 1843, when the occupant of the house at the time, Colonel George Rice, received a death threat with an empty grave dug in the ground. After 1956 the property fell into turbulent times when two owners died within the space of a few years. It was sold in 1974, and later fell into disrepair; it was occupied by squatters and thieves who removed beams and furniture.

Beals left the job for health reasons after only one year and was replaced by Mr. E. D. Adams, for whom the current Adams House was named.[4]

The main trail followed by Sullivan's troops had to pass near the steep hillside, which was only 1,000 feet (300 m) from the river.  Sullivan's advance forces discovered the Iroquois works, and Sullivan set up his artillery on a rise to the south, from which it could command not just Sullivan Hill but also another hill to the east.  After cannonading the Iroquois position, Sullivan sent troops up Baldwin Creek, which skirts the hill to the east.  These forces eventually formed a battle line that drove the Iroquois from the position.[4]
