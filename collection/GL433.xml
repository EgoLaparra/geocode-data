However, it was the first school of Northern Baden to continue teaching. As there were not enough boarding school pupils, the boarding school was closed in the 80s, but the day school has been continued and expanded. Today approx. 750 Catholic and Protestant pupils attend this school. It offers a new and old language stream covering Latin, English, French and Ancient Greek.

It is in the center of the Paynes Prairie Basin. The basin's primary source of drainage is Alachua Sink. During occasional wet periods, the basin will become full. A notable period occurred from 1871 to 1891 when the Alachua Sink was temporarily blocked. During this period, shallow draft steamboats were a frequent sight on Alachua Lake in the center of the prairie.[1] The region was also historically known as the Alachua Savannah. Its drainage has been modified by several canals. Since 1927, Camps Canal has linked the basin to the River Styx which leads to <link wikipedia="Orange_Lake_(Florida)" osm="325382" type="relation">Orange Lake</link> and eventually the Atlantic Ocean through the <link wikipedia="St._Johns_River" osm="1101516" type="relation">St. Johns River</link>. That reduced the basins water intake by half. Additional changes to the prairie's environment have been detrimental to its hydrology. In 1970, the state of Florida acquired the land and has been in the process of restoring the environment to a more natural condition ever since.[2]

Later renamed the Peacock Inn, it was where the first community gatherings in Miami were held.[1] Some visitors to the inn stayed in the area and this was the beginning of Coconut Grove, South Florida's first mainland community.[2] Closing in 1902,[3] the Peacock Inn building became the Lake Placid School until the school moved to <link wikipedia="Pompano_Beach,_Florida" osm="153949865 1216810" type="node relation">Pompano Beach</link> in 1925[4] The building was torn down in 1926.[5] Later the property became a city park.

Ever since, many skiers wanted a way to be able to ski both mountains in one day without having to ski down to the village and ride multiple lifts to get back to the alpine.  In 1997, Whistler-Blackcomb's Director of Mountain Operations, Hugh Smythe, and Paul Mathews, president of Ecosign Mountain Resort Planners, took a trip to <link wikipedia="Zermatt" osm="80387968 1685406" type="node relation">Zermatt</link>, Switzerland.

It has four pieces of key supporting steel cables with a 120 tonne loading capacity. Peak Walk is anchored by 20 pieces in the rock.[11][note 1] It was built as a tourist attraction in Europe, and it costs 1.8 million franc (about 1.2 million GBP).[12] It is expected that the current number of summertime visitors of around 50,000 will double as a result of the new bridge.[7] Three hundred people could be accommodated at a time, although the number would be reduced to 150 to ensure greater comfort.[12] The designers took the extreme conditions into account, with winds of about 200 km/h (120 mph). Mountains that can be seen from the bridge include <link wikipedia="Mont_Blanc" osm="281399025" type="node">Mont Blanc</link> (the Alps' highest point), the <link wikipedia="Matterhorn" osm="26863664" type="node">Matterhorn</link>, Mönch, <link wikipedia="Jungfrau" osm="1435708318" type="node">Jungfrau</link> and <link wikipedia="Eiger" osm="31664302" type="node">Eiger</link>, and the bridge has a partial glass floor that afford views down through it.[12][13] In addition, the bridge became the world's second highest suspension bridge after the Titlis Cliff Walk, which is 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea level.[3][14] The thin air at high altitudes and poor weather hampered construction work, and summer storms delayed the transportation of construction materials.[15]

The river watershed contains large areas of bottomland hardwood swamp and cypress swamp, providing habitat for many species of wildlife, including sturgeon and black bears. As recently as 2008, endangered Ivory-billed woodpeckers were reportedly sighted here.[3] The mouth of the river creates important marsh habitat along salinity gradients; these marshes have been the subject of many scientific studies.[4][5] It is considered to be one of the most critical areas of natural habitat remaining in Louisiana.
