It has on several occasions been damaged by vessels colliding with the structure and in 1931, a fire broke out in one of the pavilions. This wooden pavilion was never replaced, but a concrete pavilion has been used over the years as a concert hall, ballroom, cinema and for other purposes.

However, siltation of the channel between the island and the community of <link wikipedia="Atouguia_da_Baleia" osm="6548050" type="relation">Atouguia</link> on the mainland, caused by sea currents and winds, eventually led to the sea being replaced by sand dunes, with Peniche becoming a peninsula.

He also encouraged the idea of a permanent fortification on that part of the coast. In 1544, King John III recommended the construction of a castle on the peninsula and in the same year the most appropriate location to give protection to the town’s harbour was identified. Initial construction work was mainly carried out in 1557 and 1558 but work on the northeast and northwest walls continued until 1567. The design is believed to have been influenced by the castles built by Henry VIII of England, most notably <link wikipedia="Pendennis_Castle" osm="865125078" type="node">Pendennis Castle</link> in <link wikipedia="Falmouth,_Cornwall" osm="29285363" type="node">Falmouth</link>.[1][2]

The highest point, Hartcliffe Tower, is 1,194 ft (364 m) above sea level and has views over the Woodhead bypass and the Dark Peak. The surrounding countryside is predominantly rural with farming on rich well-watered soil on mainly gentle slopes rising to the bleak moorland to the west of the town. Dry stone walls, small hamlets and farms surrounded by fields and livestock are synonymous with the area. The area is known for its rugged breed of sheep, the Whitefaced Woodland. The market town itself stands at its highest point around St Johns Church at around 250 m (820 ft) above sea level. However, the surrounding land rises well over 1,000 ft (300 m) towards Cubley and Thurlstone Moors and out towards smaller hamlets at Carlecotes, Victoria, Dunford, and Crow Edge, elevated at points above 1,200 ft (370 m). There are several vantage points around Penistone that afford panoramic views of the surrounding areas of West Yorkshire and North Derbyshire.

It worked until 1936,[3] or 1938. It is said to have been worked occasionally during the <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">Second World War</link>, but was otherwise used as stables.

The mill serves as a training mill for the Gild Fryske Mounders (English: Guild of Frisian Millers').[3] On 7 July 2000, the mill was dressed overall in the Zaanse style, in celebration of its Zaan origins and the centenary of its erection in Joure.[4]
A further restoration of the mill was undertaken in 2007. The stage was rebuilt, and the cap removed from the mill to allow it to be completely rethatched.[2]

Little is known about the history of the stones. They are believed to be between 3,500 and 4,000 years old and are a Scheduled ancient monument.[1] The exposed part of each stone is about 3 m (10 ft) high and 1 m (3 ft) broad at the base, but only about 20 cm (8 in) thick. They are situated about 3 m (10 ft) apart on an open grassy place above Porth Dafarch between two low hills. They are aligned along their long axes in a northeasterly/southwesterly direction, with a fine view of the coast and towards Holyhead Mountain. There are theories that they may have formed part of a stone circle, however there is no evidence to support this. It is also said that there was previously a stone cist between them, but again this story lacks supporting evidence.[2] There may be some significance to the fact that they are located just 100 m (328 ft) from the Plas Meilw hut circle but their presence here is "quite enigmatic".[1]
