It is the most populated city in Abruzzo, with 119,217 (2018) residents (and approximately 350,000 including the surrounding metropolitan area). Located on the <link wikipedia="Adriatic_Sea" osm="9350128" type="relation">Adriatic</link> coast at the mouth of the <link wikipedia="Aterno-Pescara" osm="2506845" type="relation">Aterno-Pescara</link> River, the present-day municipality was formed in 1927 joining the municipalities of the old Pescara fortress, the part of the city to the south of the river, and Castellamare Adriatico, the part of the city to the north of the river. The surrounding area was formed into the province of Pescara.
</p>
      <p id="GL437_166_002" num_links="3">The main commercial street of the city is Corso Umberto I, which runs between two squares, starting from Piazza della Repubblica and reaching the seacoast in Piazza Primo Maggio. The rectangle that it forms with Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and Via Nicola Fabrizi is home of the main shopping district, enclosed in a driving restriction zone, where several of the best fashion shops are located. Corso Manthoné, the course of the old Pescara, has, for many years, been the center of the nightlife of the city. City hall and the administration of the province are in Piazza Italia, near the river, and in the area between here and the D'Annunzio University campus to the south, a business district has grown up over the years, while the Marina is situated to the immediate south of the mouth of the river. Pescara is also served by an important international airport, the <link wikipedia="Abruzzo_Airport" osm="7028144" type="way">Abruzzo Airport</link>, and one of the major touristic ports of <link wikipedia="Adriatic_Sea" osm="9350128" type="relation">Adriatic Sea</link> and <link wikipedia="Italy" osm="26347360 365331" type="node relation">Italy</link>, the Port of Pescara.

The cathedral, dedicated to Saint Cetteus, patron saint of Pescara, has been the seat of the Archbishop of Pescara-Penne since the creation of the archdiocese in 1982. The present Romanesque Revival building, originally called the Tempio della Conciliazione ("Temple of Conciliation"), was constructed in the 1930s, replacing the medieval church of San Cetteo.

</p>
      <p id="GL437_167_002" num_links="2">The construction of the present church was linked with the wave of intensive building activity that accompanied the creation of the city and <link wikipedia="Province_of_Pescara" osm="41778" type="relation">province of Pescara</link> in 1927. The medieval church of St. Cetteus (Italian: Chiesa di San Cetteo) that formerly stood on the site had fallen into such disrepair that it was demolished (a few traces of the old building can be seen on the pavement opposite). The construction of the new church was vigorously promoted by the writer Gabriele D'Annunzio, who had been baptised in the demolished church, and who was a generous donor to the project.[1] D'Annunzio, one of whose principal concerns was to build a suitable tomb for his mother, commissioned the architect Cesare Bazzani.[2] Work lasted from 1933 to 1938 or 1939. The façade had to be reconstructed after <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link> as a result of war damages.

Famous for its sanctuary, the village is divided into two parts:  the old suburb, "Pescosansonesco Vecchio",  and the new village, "Pescosansonesco Nuovo", which was rebuilt some 3 kilometres (2 mi) away, in the “Ambrosian” region. The vecchio borough of Pescosansonesco was abandoned in 1944 due to numerous landslides caused by a series of earthquakes. Before the establishment of Pescosansonesco in the 10th century, there was an ancient settlement, called Pagus. The pre-roman inhabitants  that lived in the area created a sanctuary at Lake Morrone in the 5th century BC and created the village of  Pescosansonescorose in the 10th century AD.[4]

At first, he worked as a painter, illustrator and bookbinder in an artisanal fashion. He frequented the bohemian circles and was interested in subjects related to the reform of lifestyles. In 1899 Behrens accepted the invitation of the Grand Duke Ernst-Ludwig of Hesse to be the second member of his recently inaugurated Darmstadt Artists' Colony, where Behrens built his own house and fully conceived everything inside the house (furniture, towels, paintings, pottery, etc.)  The building of this house is considered to be the turning point in his life, when he left the artistic circles of Munich and moved away from the Jugendstil towards a sober and austere style of design.

The land on which Petersville is situated was originally patented by Captain John Colvill as the "Merryland Tract" on November 5, 1731, containing over 6,000 acres.[2] Shortly after the Revolutionary War, Petersville began to develop as a village, with lots facing the turnpike route and four cross streets. The village also sat at the crossroads of one of the valley's north-south roads leading from <link wikipedia="Middletown,_Maryland" osm="133238" type="relation">Middletown</link> to Berlin (today <link wikipedia="Brunswick,_Maryland" osm="133206" type="relation">Brunswick</link>).

Five years later, in October 1813, the Petersville Post Office was established (it closed in 1909).[3] The Maryland General Assembly established the Petersville District in 1829.[4]

The dam was complete in February 1993 and the first generator was operational in January 1994. The last went online in 1995.[1] It is owned by Électricité de France.[2] Construction of the dam and impounding of its large 3,500,000,000 m3 (2,800,000 acre⋅ft) reservoir led to several environmental issues that continue to be monitored and addressed.

The Vilijampolė Bridge across the <link wikipedia="Neris" osm="2824450" type="relation">Neris River</link> received special attention from the Lithuanian rebels during the June Uprising in Lithuania in 1941 as they expected the Germans to enter the city using this bridge.[1] When the Lithuanians got to the bridge, it was already wired by Red Army with explosives. 40 Soviet troops and three armoured vehicles protected the bridge and waited for the right moment to detonate.[2] When the Soviets retreated a bit after facing Lithuanian fire, Juozas Savulionis ran to the middle of the bridge, cut the wires, and thus saved it from destruction. On his way back Savulionis was shot and killed by Soviet fire, becoming one of the first victims of the uprising.[2]
It was destroyed in 1944 by Wehrmacht as the Soviet forces were approaching. It was rebuilt in  1948 and renovated in 2008. It was named after Petras Vileišis, an engineer from Interbellum Lithuania.
