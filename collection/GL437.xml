The asset management division is constituted of more than 300 MBA holders from top-tier schools. Its members include cooperative federations such as the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA) and the Japan Fishery Cooperatives (JF). Norinchukin supports political lobbies who oppose agricultural imports and the deterioration of living standards in rural areas.

</p>
      <p id="GL437_099_002" num_links="2">The Norinchukin Bank was founded on December 20, 1923 by the Japanese government to support the country's agriculture industry. Norinchukin is derived from the bank’s Japanese name Nō - Rin - Chūō - Kinko (Agriculture - forestry - central - credit union). Norinchukin suffered from a lack of investment funds during <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>, due to restrictions by the Japanese government.  After the war, Norinchukin played an important role in rebuilding the country. Once the government encouraged divestment in the textile industry, Norinchukin formed a political lobby to support the agriculture sector. In 1979, Norinchukin set up an international department and formed a relationship with the <link wikipedia="Bank_of_Japan" osm="3069611" type="relation">Bank of Japan</link>. Low interest rates in the 1980s impacted Norinchukin's profitability. The Japanese government adjusted the charter of Norinchukin in 1986 and allowed the bank to operate as a commercial bank. Following the global recession in 2008, Norinchukin indicated it had ¥9.7 billion in losses related to the subprime mortgage crisis.[1][2] For the 2009 fiscal year, Norinchukin posted a net income of ¥29.5 billion.

As a tribute to his French wife, Moineau, Benítez decided to construct a structure that imitated the lavish settings of the ocean liner. Designed by architect Raúl Reichard (1908–1996), the hotel began construction in 1938. The hotel's exterior was designed to resemble a luxury liner, elongated and curved in front, with portal-shape windows and lights. Inside, the hotel features art deco design, complete with Roman, <link wikipedia="Egypt" osm="424316018 1473947" type="node relation">Egyptian</link>, and <link wikipedia="France" osm="11980 2202162" type="relation relation">French</link> details, high ceilings, and corridors looking down into a central skylighted atrium.

      <p id="GL437_164_001" num_links="2">Normansville was originally called Upper Hollow; it was named for the deep ravine carved by the Normans Kill in which it was located. Further downstream was Lower Hollow, later named <link wikipedia="Kenwood,_Albany,_New_York" osm="158858309" type="node">Kenwood</link>. Upper Hollow had its start in 1805 with the construction of the Delaware Turnpike, which ran from the City of Albany to Otego (which then was part of <link wikipedia="Delaware_County,_New_York" osm="1838017" type="relation">Delaware County</link>).[1] The Turnpike was carried over the Normans Kill ("kill" is the Dutch word for "stream") by a 100-foot-long (30 m) wooden bridge. Northwest of this bridge was a toll gate. The wood bridge was washed away by a freshet in 1869[2] (one year after the turnpike company had abandoned the Turnpike) and the Town of Bethlehem built an iron bridge in its place.[1][2]

The original village of Normanton-by-Derby, which now forms the southern part of the suburb, dates back to the medieval period. As the Normanton area became rapidly urbanised in the 19th century, the New Normanton area to the north was developed for housing, linking the old village to Derby, into which it was eventually absorbed. The area is characterised by high density late 19th century terraced housing in New Normanton and mid-20th century housing estates elsewhere, and has the most ethnically diverse population in Derby. The Normanton ward had a population of 17,071 in 2011.

The 2009 expansion of the district, included a single building, the Morehouse Bakery building at 5-9 Mill Street.[2]

Today, the governor and their immediate staff occupy offices on the first floor of the Capitol.

</p>
      <p id="GL437_412_002" num_links="3">The building was built following the destruction by fire of the first North Carolina State House in 1831,[3] and today houses the offices of the Governor of North Carolina. It is located in the state capitol of <link wikipedia="Raleigh,_North_Carolina" osm="158618991 179052" type="node relation">Raleigh</link> on Union Square at One East Edenton Street. The cornerstone of the Greek Revival building was laid with Masonic honors by the Grand Master of North Carolina Masons Simmons Jones Baker on July 4, 1833.[4] Construction was completed in 1840.[5] It was designed primarily by the architectural firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis.  Often credited solely to that team, the design of the capitol was actually the result of a sequence of work by William Nichols, Sr. and his son William Nichols, Jr., Town and Davis, and then David Paton.[6]
The Capitol housed the entire state government until 1888, and the North Carolina General Assembly met in the capitol building until 1961. The legislature relocated to its current location in the <link wikipedia="North_Carolina_State_Legislative_Building" osm="47776644" type="way">North Carolina State Legislative Building</link> in 1963. The <link wikipedia="North_Carolina_Supreme_Court" osm="47760090" type="way">North Carolina Supreme Court</link> has also convened in the building in the past, most recently meeting in the capitol's senate chamber in 2005 while the Supreme Court Building was undergoing renovations. The Governor and the governor's immediate staff has continued to occupy offices in the building.[7] The Capitol remains largely unaltered from its 1840 state. Only three rooms have been significantly altered through remodeling: the two committee rooms in the east and west wings of the second floor, which were divided horizontally to provide space for restrooms, and the office in the east wing of the first floor, part of which had to be cut away to permit space for an elevator to be installed in 1951.[8] The Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973 and the building is located in the Capitol Area Historic District.[2][9]
