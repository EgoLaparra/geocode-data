As is true with all the glaciers found on Glacier Peak, North Guardian Glacier is retreating.[3] North Guardian Glacier retreated approximately 1,500 m (4,900 ft) between 1850 and 1946, however during a cooler and wetter period from about 1950 to 1979, the glacier advanced modestly. Since then North Guardian Glacier resumed retreating and thinning and by 2005 the glacier had returned to its minimum length as recorded in 1946.[4]

      <p id="GL438_202_002" num_links="3">At its creation in 1963, it was largely farmland on the western edge of development in Broward County.  North Lauderdale was originally grazing pasture for cows and horses of the Anderson Dairy Farm and also an agricultural area for the Lena Lyons Stringbean Farm.  Recognizing a rare opportunity to work with a blank slate, famed architect Morris Lapidus turned his attention to planning a city that would become North Lauderdale.  Lapidus gained international notoriety for launching the 1950s “<link wikipedia="Miami_Beach,_Florida" osm="154141895 118856" type="node relation">Miami Beach</link>” style resort hotel.  His design of the <link wikipedia="Fontainebleau_Miami_Beach" osm="1038908658" type="node">Fontainebleau Resort</link>, the <link wikipedia="Eden_Roc_Miami_Beach_Hotel" osm="135296603" type="way">Eden Roc</link> and Americana helped create the style of Miami Beach.  After hotels, Lapidus turned to designing cities.  North Lauderdale, “The City of Tomorrow”, was the first city he laid out.  Residents still benefit from his influence and vision, which can be seen in the whimsical “beacons” lending the city prominence and in the distinct, amoebic shape of Boulevard of Champions.  In the late 60's, recognizing the growing demand for single-family homes, the Osias Organization, headed by Colonel Nathan Rood, who was also the first appointed Mayor, purchased most of the land and began the development of North Lauderdale proper.  In April 1969, by straw vote, Michael Saraniero became the City's first elected Mayor.

The current campus of NMHS was the newly constructed "Medford Senior High School", with grades 11 and 12 attending while grades 9 and 10 went to Medford Mid High School, which later became <link wikipedia="South_Medford_High_School" osm="455331907" type="way">South Medford High School</link> (SMHS) and ultimately Central Medford High School.

Shortly after, the school reimagined itself as the Girton School For Girls.[10] The school built three more buildings on what was then known as the Garland Estate, but by 1918-19 the school began to encounter funding difficulties. A group of parents and alumni from the Girton School and local area came together in 1919 and chose Perry Dunlap Smith to found the North Shore Country Day School for girls and boys of all ages. With the popularity of the Country Day School movement, this was seen as the next logical step for the school. The school continues to have no class rankings and no academic awards.[11] As it became clear the Country Day school would outlast its time as a traditional school, the founder and first headmaster Perry Dunlap Smith hired Chicago area architect Edwin H. Clark to redesign the school grounds.[11][12]
