Precedent-setting trials on water rights were held here, along with the "White Cap" murder trial, a notorious episode in vigilantism held here in 1890. This brick courthouse, constructed by A.P. Pettit in 1870–71, was one of the few buildings in the vicinity to survive the 1906 San Francisco earthquake with only minor damage. It is now California Historical Landmark #897 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NPS-70000134).[2] The county schools library was located in the basement until at least 1968. It is surrounded by a Lakeport City Park.

      <p id="GL451_100_002" num_links="5">In the 18th century, the nascent Georgetown College, with only one building on its campus in the <link wikipedia="Georgetown_(Washington,_D.C.)" osm="4639452" type="relation">Georgetown</link> neighborhood of Washington, D.C., was in continual need of additional space. Therefore, in 1792, with all of the college's facilities housed within the South Building (which was demolished in 1904), land was purchased for the construction of an additional building. Construction started in 1794[1] on what became known as the North Building, and work on its edifice was completed by 1795. The architect is believed to have been Leonard Harbaugh, the <link wikipedia="Baltimore" osm="671113 154196553 133345" type="node node relation">Baltimore</link>-based designer of <link wikipedia="Holy_Trinity_Catholic_Church_(Washington,_D.C.)" osm="66346520" type="way">Holy Trinity Chapel</link>.[1] The building was modeled after <link wikipedia="Nassau_Hall" osm="27341267" type="way">Nassau Hall</link> at Princeton University. Funding the construction of a building of its size was difficult for the school. The total cost of its initial construction exceeded £10,000, a sum significantly greater than the revenue from the Jesuits' <link wikipedia="Maryland" osm="316964668 162112" type="node relation">Maryland</link> plantations, which were funding the project. The board of directors was required to raise tuition, cut President Robert Plunkett's salary by more than half,[1] and make some payments in the form of cows raised on campus as barter, rather than in cash. The interior of the building was not complete until 1809, with an anonymous contribution of $400. Upon completion, the 154-foot-long building increased the amount of dormitory space on campus fourfold. It also housed classrooms, a refectory,[5] and a chapel.[2] The building finally opened for use in 1797.[1]

      <p id="GL451_113_002" num_links="3">The neighborhood derives its name from the large orchards that existed on the land prior to being developed in the 1920s. It was developed by the B.C. Bowen Co. (one of the founders of the present day Welles-Bowen Realty Company) who is credited with selecting the Old Orchard name. Accounts tell of a large apple orchard near the corner of Densmore and Bancroft and a peach orchard near Pemberton and Middlesex. Mr. Bowen is also credited with selecting the English-sounding street names, although no information exists as to why. One potential explanation is that Mr. Bowen had also developed the Westmoreland neighborhood (about 1 mile east of Old Orchard) around 1917 and selected those street names from areas in <link wikipedia="Virginia" osm="317004702 224042" type="node relation">Virginia</link> (<link wikipedia="Mount_Vernon" osm="232724526" type="way">Mount Vernon</link>, <link wikipedia="Richmond,_Virginia" osm="2592301390 3864712" type="node relation">Richmond</link>, Potomac), as the rolling terrain reminded him of that part of the country.

Although there is no direct structural evidence, a building used in the industry may have occupied the site before the present structure; slag remnants have been unearthed on the land outside it.[7]  Furthermore, the site is very close to the ancient junction of the east–west and northeast–southwest trackways and rudimentary roads which ran between the main furnaces and forges in the area, at places such as <link wikipedia="Ifield,_West_Sussex" osm="150877218" type="node">Ifield</link> and <link wikipedia="Bewbush" osm="150876990" type="node">Bewbush</link>.[7][8]  These ancient tracks were superseded by the High Street, on a north–south alignment, after the Norman Conquest in the 11th century.[8]

The white, wooden church was built in 1877 using plans by the architect Hans Linstow.  The church seats about 200 people.  Over time, the church became too small for the parish.  In 1999, the church was retired from regular use when the new, much larger <link wikipedia="Riska_Church" osm="1074987610" type="node">Riska Church</link> was completed (about a block to the northeast).

It was given a Grade I listing on 14 December 1955. It is one of the most important non-fortified manor houses of the Middle Ages still in existence. It was built about 1380 as a hall house and was greatly expanded in the late 16th century and partly demolished in 1785. The original 14th-century house survives, although much altered. This article is based on the work of Bridie (1955), which has however been superseded as the standard work of reference on the architectural history of the building by the unpublished Exeter Archaeology Report of 2008 produced for the <link wikipedia="National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty" osm="143436969" type="way">National Trust</link>.[1] This report draws on new evidence gained from the recently discovered survey of 1559 made by Sir William Petre, which lists each main room of the then existing house together with its contents. From this evidence a conjectural ground plan of the house pre-1785  was recently produced by Roger Waterhouse.

The National Register nomination notes that much of the work on the building was done by master stonecutters with the result that the "cutting and fitting [of the stone] is exceptionally well executed."[2] The walls are 20 inches (51 cm) thick.[2]

The church is also known as the Norwegian: Rosekyrkja or "Rose Church" because the interior walls and ceilings are painted with rosemaling, a decorative style of painting that is common in Norway. It is one of the most decorated churches in Norway.[3] Wood materials from the stave church was probably reused, such as in the roof of the vestibule and the four large columns. There is a crucifix (13th century) and a baptismal font from the older church. The stave church was likely rose painted inside too.[4]

The core area also has listed 1700s buildings. Towards Ekeberg slope and further up are some 17th and 18th-century wooden houses that are zoned for conservation under the Planning and Building Act, though there exist in the Old Town many four-storey brick houses, built at the end of the 1800s, and some heritage railway buildings from different eras.

With a rough winter, the Sisters found the need to house students, and thus boarding began at Oldenburg Academy.  By 1986, the enrollment was up to 117.  Oldenburg Academy received its commission as a high school in 1910.  In the 1940s, great changes occurred:  the school moved to being a high school only and moved away from the elementary level.  Later, the Sisters relinquished control of the Academy and in 1994, Oldenburg Academy incorporated and began control by a Board of Trustees.  The boarding program ended at the end of the 1998-1999 school year.  And young men were admitted beginning in the fall of 2000.  The Alma Mater inspires students to "virtue, honor, and education."

A small schoolhouse was built nearby in 1856, which was later converted to a private residence.

      <p id="GL451_476_001" num_links="2">Olešnice probably originated in the 11th century but the first written record of Olešnice dates back to 1073, while the first official record is from 1348. During the colonization of the Bohemian border regions in the mid-13th century, German colonists built settlement German Oels on the east bank opposite the village Olešnice (in the area of today's marketplace). The part of the village on the Moravian side was called Moravian Olešnice while the German part was called German Olešnice. German Olešnice developed into a market town, and gt township status in 1360's. In 1442 Olešnice fell to the Hussites and was plundered. Olešnice was firstly part of the dominion Louka and was owned by the Lords of Lomnice. Until 1496 the township was property of the Nobility from Pernštejn, later it belonged to <link wikipedia="Kunštát" osm="436850" type="relation">Kunštát</link> dominion and between 1678 and 1733 to the Nobility from Lamberk. During the Thirty Years War the township suffered heavy damage and 800 inhabitants left the devastated site. Even though the new owners tried to repopulate the township, 24 from 123 were still deserted in 1674. Until 1759, the municipal property was managed separately by the German and Moravian part of the township. In 1759 both parts made an agreement about joint management of the municipal property. In 1799, the Meat Market at the St. Lawrence Church was converted into a school building. In the beginning of the 19th century Olešnice suffered from several fires whereof the most devastating was the 1827 fire. This fire destroyed <link wikipedia="Saint_Lawrence" osm="293534851" type="node">Lawrence of Rome</link> Church from the 15th century. In 1850 an artificial flowers production started in the town. A cloth weaver manufacture was established in the mid 18th century and from 1816 blueprint started in Danzinger family. Olešnice has been using flag since 1997 and in December 1999 it acquired status of town. Town's coat of arms is related to coat of arms of Nobility from Lomnice.
