      <p id="GL452_095_001" num_links="2">The name Port Sulphur derives from the Freeport Sulphur Company in the early 1930s, when it set up logistics, refining, storage and shipping operations to support its Frasch Process sulphur mine at Lake Grande Ecaille, located 10 miles west of the town in the nearby marsh.[2] The Grande Ecaille mine was the largest sulphur deposit in the world when it began operation in 1933, and remained in production until 1978. Over time, as other discoveries were made, the Freeport Sulphur Company also used the Port Sulphur facility to support their other Frasch Process sulphur mines located at Garden Island Bay, Lake Pelto, and Caillou Island; a land-based mine at Chacahoula; the first offshore sulphur mines at Grand Isle and Caminada Pass; and a large operation 50 miles offshore from the Mississippi River Delta in 300 feet of water, at Main Pass Block 299 in the <link wikipedia="Gulf_of_Mexico" osm="305639190" type="node">Gulf of Mexico</link>. The facility was also used to process and ship recovered sulphur obtained by oil and gas refining. The terminal was able to filter and store liquid hot molten sulphur in large insulated heated tanks, and "vat" liquid sulphur into acres of long term dry storage by forming blocks of bright yellow sulphur by spraying molten sulphur into metal forms on the ground and allowing to cool. The site is valuable because of its proximity to sulphur producing areas near the Gulf of Mexico, its docking sites along the <link wikipedia="Mississippi_River" osm="1756854" type="relation">Mississippi River</link> and back bay marsh.

      <p id="GL452_106_001" num_links="4">Port Townsend is located at the northeastern tip of Washington's Olympic Peninsula, and developed beginning about 1850 as a strategically placed well-sheltered deep-harbor port at the junction of the <link wikipedia="Strait_of_Juan_de_Fuca" osm="305640295" type="node">Strait of Juan de Fuca</link> and the Admiralty Inlet, which provide access to <link wikipedia="Puget_Sound" osm="369028433" type="node">Puget Sound</link>.  It grew as a major customs point, and as a shipment point for lumber taken from the peninsula's forests.

The town grew from under 1,000 residents to about 4,500 between 1880 and 1890, and is estimated to have peaked at between 7,000 and 8,000 at the height of the development boom.  It is estimated that enough housing was built to support a population of 20,000, an optimistic target that the city has never reached.  The building boom came to an abrupt end when the railroad endeavour was bankrupted in 1890.  Although the local economy has been periodically stimulated (e.g., by the construction of <link wikipedia="Fort_Worden" osm="319113243" type="way">Fort Worden</link> in the early 20th century), the population quickly dwindled to about 2,000, and grew slowly over the 20th century. Because of the speed at which the economy of Port Townsend fell and the non-existence of any industry or economy to replace it, very few of the Victorian buildings were torn down or heavily renovated. They were, in essence, preserved as time capsules for the next 100 years until the value of keeping them intact was appreciated and fostered.[1]

In 1835, General Wooster Harrison became the town's first permanent settler, in what he originally named "Wisconsin City." Harrison later renamed the town "Washington".[5][6] Harrison's wife, Rhoda, was the first white settler to be buried in the town, when she died in 1837.[7] Around 1843 the name was changed to "Sauk Washington". The town of Port Washington was formed in January 1846 and until 1847 included the surrounding areas and what is currently <link wikipedia="Fredonia,_Wisconsin" osm="252011" type="relation">Fredonia</link>, <link wikipedia="Saukville,_Wisconsin" osm="251349" type="relation">Saukville</link>, and <link wikipedia="Belgium,_Wisconsin" osm="252009" type="relation">Belgium</link>.[8] Appropriately, it was originally the county seat for <link wikipedia="Washington_County,_Wisconsin" osm="270624" type="relation">Washington County</link> until that county was bisected in 1853, with its former lakeside townships becoming the new Ozaukee County, and Port Washington becoming the new county's seat (Washington County's seat moved to <link wikipedia="West_Bend,_Wisconsin" osm="251641" type="relation">West Bend</link>).[9] The City of Port Washington was incorporated with its present name in 1882.

It suffered many sieges and fell under Christian domination in 1489. In 1522, Almería was devastated by an earthquake and rebuilding and recovery did not really get underway until the 19th century.

The Neoclassical arch was built to commemorate the visit of Francis I of Austria in 1825. It was reconstructed from 1826 to 1828 by Giacomo Moraglia and dedicated to Garibaldi in 1860. Built in the Doric style, the gate is flanked by two portals overlooking the street.[1] The customs houses were added in 1836. Its less than  monumental proportions are better suited to the surrounding streets as the gate used to be at the end of a winding road, hardly compatible with a grandiose project.[2]

The Portuguese built the gate in 1849 to replace a crumbling wall that the Chinese erected during the Ming dynasty in 1573.[1][2] The Chinese built a garrisoned wall to control the flow of people and goods.[3] It was the site of the Passaleão incident, a clash between the Qing dynasty and the Kingdom of Portugal in 1849 over the death of Macau's governor Ferreira do Amaral. Led by Colonel Mesquita, Portugal won the small battle which led to the extension of Macau's border northwards.[4] At the limit of said expansion, the Portas do Cerco was built with the inscription "A pátria honrai, que a pátria vos contempla" (Portuguese for "Honor your motherland, for your motherland looks over you") on the façade on its inner arch in 1849. The Barrier Gate served as a de facto boundary, but the precise limits of Macau's border has never been formally demarcated.[5]

The Porte d’Aix was initially conceived in 1784 to honour Louis XIV and to commemorate the Peace of Paris (1783) that ended the American war of independence. Following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814-15, the project was resumed in 1823, now to commemorate French victories in the Spanish Expedition, notably at the Battle of Trocadero, August 31, 1823. It was eventually completed in 1839, with a more general theme of victory.[2]

His troops blasted a hole in the old thirteenth century ramparts that ran the length of the rue d'Aix between the city gates of "Porte Royale" and "Porte d'Aix". Part of the subsequent reorganisation of Marseille involved not only an increased military presence, demolition of the old ramparts, new royal shipyards (Arsenal des Galères) and seaward fortifications, but also a new governing body drawn from the merchant class, charged with making plans to expand and beautify the city.

      <p id="GL452_428_001" num_links="3">The lighthouse was first built in 1855, as a wooden structure, but the breakwater was extended and a new lighthouse was constructed at the end of it in 1875. The new lighthouse was made of curved cast-iron plates whose seams are disguised by six decorative Corinthian columns. Its design was inspired by the <link wikipedia="Choragic_Monument_of_Lysicrates" osm="157180174" type="way">Choragic Monument of Lysicrates</link> in Athens, made well known by engravings.  The architect was Thomas U. Walter, most noted as the designer of the <link wikipedia="United_States_Capitol" osm="66418809" type="way">U.S. Capitol</link> east and west wings and its current dome. Wooden sheds and a six-room house for the lighthouse-keeper were added incrementally as needed. In 1897 <link wikipedia="Spring_Point_Ledge_Light" osm="4497717996" type="node">Spring Point Ledge Light</link> was erected and the houses around Bug Light were demolished and the Spring Point Ledge Lighthouse keepers tended to both lighthouses. During World War II, the breakwater was slowly absorbed by landfill as the New England Shipbuilding Corporation built two shipyards next to the lighthouse. These shipyards produced Liberty Ships for the war effort. Because of the smaller breakwater, there was a lesser need for the lighthouse and it was decommissioned in 1943.[1]
