For instance, the main entrance is marked by a nebulous-shaped canopy unlike anything being designed at that time by the older generation of modernist architects. The building is widely regarded as one of his most important early designs — designed at the same time as the <link wikipedia="Vyborg_Library" osm="2144530" type="relation">Vyborg Library</link>.

The stage was renewed in 1961 and in 1967 the mill was sold to the Gemeente Peize.[2] The mill was restored in 1971-72 by millwright Alserda of <link wikipedia="Doezum" osm="1475763" type="relation">Doezum</link>, Groningen. The Patent sails were replaced with Common sails and the smock was thatched. In 1980, new patent sails were fitted by millwright Doornbosch of Adorp, Groningen. They were renewed in 1990, again by Doornbosch.[4]

Its name can be linked to Anglo-Saxon roots, Pacca being the founder of a settlement on the hill surrounding Pakenham church, an area higher than the waters of Pakenham Fen. The discovery of many Anglo-Saxon remains, notably that of a bone-toothed comb in the old school garden (just over the road from the church) in the 1950s, testify to the authenticity of the site. The village was therefore named Pacca's Ham, i.e., the home of Pacca, a name which eventually became Pakenham, (pronounced locally with a long "a" sound.) The Anglo-Saxon family name later becomes "de Pakenham". Pacca's descendants continued to farm here until the Norman Conquest, 1066.

Its petal shaped structure is derived from the traditional muqarnas of Mughal architecture. As the architect says: "We should learn from history but not remain in it." He used today's technology to modernize the historical form of the muqarnas. The resultant petal-shaped structure emphasizes the importance of unity and togetherness of the people of Pakistan. Rather than symbolizing the four provinces (as is mistakenly observed), it represents the four different cultures of the people of Pakistan. The four large petals represent each of the four cultures, the Punjabi, the Balochi, the Sindhi and the Pakhtun. The three smaller petals represent: the Minorities, <link wikipedia="Azad_Kashmir" osm="316441063 3780130" type="node relation">Azad Kashmir</link> and Gilgit Baltistan . All seven petals, though independent of each other, stand together in unison to form the nation of Pakistan. Standing together, they are protecting the star and the crescent of the flag of Pakistan. The star of the flag in the monument is designed in shiny black granite with golden stars, which represent the people who sacrificed their life for Pakistan. The moon crescent is made from stainless steel with inspirational writings of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah and Allama Iqbal.  The petals are built of granite (projecting in a suspended cantilever form, among the largest in Asia) and its inner walls are covered with artwork depicting the various landmarks of the Pakistan, such as: <link wikipedia="Lahore_Fort" osm="105841051" type="way">Lahore Fort</link>, <link wikipedia="Badshahi_Mosque" osm="5254181754 8420174" type="node relation">Badshahi Mosque</link>, <link wikipedia="Khyber_Pass" osm="3309507563" type="node">Khyber Pass</link> and Minar-e-Pakistan.

These two structures are connected by a large piazza, known as the Freedom Plaza. Though the name of the architect–Arif Masoud–is inscribed in stone in the main Dedication Plaque located at the beginning of the main plaza–he has honored all construction workers by placing their hand impressions all along the long walls flanking this Freedom Plaza on both the sides.

From 1913 through about 1929, the Palace attained legendary status among vaudeville performers as the flagship of the Keith–Albee organization, and the most desired booking in the country. With 1,610 seats (as of 2018)[2] spread over three levels, it is one of the largest theaters on Broadway, housing primarily large musicals and concert engagements. On September 16, 2018, following the run of SpongeBob SquarePants, the theater closed for an extensive renovation, and is expected to reopen in 2021.[3]

It is located on the corner of Gradillas a Monjas opposite the Plaza Bolívar, occupying half of the plaza's southern section. The building dates from the seventeenth century but now bears the mark of Alejandro Chataing's Neoclassical additions in 1906. It was the focal point for the Constitutional Convention, and signing of the Declaration of Independence in the nineteenth century (declared on 5 July 1811 and hence known as the "cradle of independence"). The present building is the result of the work undertaken by the Venezuelan architect Alejandro Chataing in 1906. The west wing of the building, the Capilla de Santa Rosa de Lima (Santa Rosa chapel), the chapel where Venezuela's independence was declared in 1811, has been fully restored and furnished with authentic period pieces. The ground floor houses the Museo Caracas (Caracas Museum), which contains works by Venezuela's most celebrated painters and many other historic artifacts. It was declared a National Historic Landmark on 16 February 1979.
