Pflueger had designed the library with the intent that Rivera's mural would cover three walls;[3] the mural as-completed would be mounted on the south wall of the library's reading room, and Rivera intended to return once the library was complete to add murals to the west and east walls.[4] Both the San Francisco Art Commission and Board of Education received protests over the mural's content before its completion, primarily because of the included caricatures of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. The Art Commission approved the artistic merit in August 1940 but deferred the judgement of appropriate subject matter to the Board of Education.[5] Pflueger announced that Rivera would continue to work on the mural for "at least another week" after the close of GGIE.[6]

Many years later, after the restoration of images, the inhabitants of the area saw a strange light shining from this point on the mountain. They found the icon and built a monastery immediately below in the name of the Virgin and the wormwood bush. The monastery was known in western medieval sources as the Abbey of Abscithi or Apinthi.[1] Sometimes it was simply called Psithia, as in the Chronicle of George Boustronios.[2]

The canal cuts across the <link wikipedia="Isthmus_of_Panama" osm="6251907747" type="node">Isthmus of Panama</link> and is a conduit for maritime trade.  Canal locks are at each end to lift ships up to <link wikipedia="Gatun_Lake" osm="1410768" type="relation">Gatun Lake</link>, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 m (85 ft) <link wikipedia="Metres_above_sea_level" osm="4880802076" type="node">above sea level</link>, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 32.5 m (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, neo-Panamax ships, capable of handling more cargo.[1]

The original canal had a total of six steps (three up, three down) for a ship's passage. The total length of the lock structures, including the approach walls, is over 1.9 miles (3 km). The locks were one of the greatest engineering works ever to be undertaken when they opened in 1914. No other concrete construction of comparable size was undertaken until the <link wikipedia="Hoover_Dam" osm="49938932 1652352" type="way relation">Hoover Dam</link>, in the 1930s.
