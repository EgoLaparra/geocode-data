      <p id="GL468_097_001" num_links="6">Park Road Shopping Center opened up on November 15, 1956 and was Charlotte's very first open area-type shopping mall.  Developed by A.V. Blankenship, it is typical of Mid-Century modern architecture and the  original billboard sign remains today.  When  the mall was first envisioned, it was considered to be a shift in area business development.  At this time period most of the shopping areas were still  located in and around downtown Charlotte.  Meanwhile, more and more people continued to move to the suburbs and outlying areas of the city.[1]  This has been the catalyst that has kept the shopping center successful to this day.  Park Road Shopping Center is a very bustling mall and serves many of the surrounding Charlotte neighborhoods such as <link wikipedia="Myers_Park_(Charlotte)" osm="154038238" type="node">Myers Park</link>, Barclay Downs, Parkdale, Colonial Village, Madison Park, <link wikipedia="Sedgefield_(Charlotte_neighborhood)" osm="153974353" type="node">Sedgefield</link>, Ashbrook, and <link wikipedia="Starmount_(Charlotte_neighborhood)" osm="153837371" type="node">Starmount</link>.   In 1967 a local attorney named Porter Byrum bought Park Road Shopping  Center.  On June 16, 2011 Mr. Byrum announced that Park Road Shopping Center would be donated to 3 local colleges (<link wikipedia="Queens_University_of_Charlotte" osm="206288382" type="way">Queens University of Charlotte</link>, <link wikipedia="Wingate_University" osm="8369265" type="relation">Wingate University</link>, and <link wikipedia="Wake_Forest_University" osm="357788427" type="node">Wake Forest University</link>).[2]   Mr. Byrum had held  ownership of the shopping center for nearly 44 years.  Just one month later these 3 colleges sold the shopping center for $82 million to EDENS, a   shopping center operator and developer.[3] Despite these sudden changes in ownership, it is expected that the shopping center will continue on as is.  It is easy to walk or bike to the Park Road Shopping Center since it lies on the Little Sugar Creek Greenway.  In 2014 the center underwent a renovation. It was painted white, given wooden features, outdoor seating was added and the covered walkways got new lighting and floor treatment.

The hall is difficult to view for the general public, being surrounded by high walls and housing, although a glimpse of its northern side can be seen from Ecclesall Road South.

      <p id="GL468_182_002" num_links="2">The building was constructed in 1864 - 65 by the architect John Brightmore Mitchell-Withers (1838-1894) for his own use. It was originally named The Woodlands and Mitchell-Withers created the house as a Gothic fantasy with carved human heads looking out from the eaves and the front door. The dining room was panelled with <link wikipedia="Oak" osm="5550827007 6521030135 6521479335 6521565360" type="node node node node">oak</link> taken from the long gallery of <link wikipedia="Sheffield_Manor_Lodge" osm="3090802190" type="node">Sheffield Manor</link>. The grounds were landscaped with many trees and included kitchen gardens, orchards, stables, a carriage house and harness room. Withers-Mitchell lived at The Woodlands with his wife Lise and by 1871 they had three children, the oldest of which, John, would also become a well-regarded architect like his father. John Mitchell-Withers senior died at the young age of 56 in 1894 and in June 1898 The Woodlands was sold to Sir Robert Hadfield, the metallurgist and owner of the vast Hadfields steel foundry in the east end of Sheffield.

The property was purchased in October 2005 for approximately $687,000,000 by a joint venture between Stellar Management and Rockpoint Group from a JP Morgan Chase and Carmel Partners joint venture entity.

      <p id="GL468_209_002" num_links="11">The apartment towers were designed by Leonard Schultze and Associates, the post-War successor firm to Schultze and Weaver, in partnership with prominent landscape architect Thomas Dolliver Church.

The first tenants moved into the Font Boulevard buildings in early 1944.

Parkmerced’s unusual pie-shaped blocks were designed by its architect, Leonard Schultze, and shares many features with his Park La Brea design. Schultze worked closely with landscape architect Thomas Dolliver Church, who often collaborated with cutting-edge, Modern architects, to refine the plan for Parkmerced. Church developed a unifying concept for the landscaping of each individually designed and graded garden courtyard, the different street types, open spaces such as Robert Pender Park in Juan Bautista Circle [dedicated May 3, 2009], the Meadow and the recreation area, aided by office intern Robert Royston.[1]

Development of the subdivision (initially called "Fairhaven II" after the neighbouring community to the east, began in the early 1980s. The extreme west end of the neighbourhood remained undeveloped until the subsequent creation of the adjacent Blairmore Suburban Centre led to the final phase of Parkridge being built out in the early 2010s. Whereas the majority of residents are employed in the sales and service sector, the next highest employer is business, finance and administration.  The two main age groups are those in their 40s and teenagers as of 2005.[1]  Until recently Parkridge was the farthest western neighbourhood of Saskatoon south of 22nd Street.

This, however, is only a fraction of the entire system which many experts believe still holds another 800 caves. 
Only a small part of the complex is open to the public. The 268-acre park built around the cave system features tours of some of the caves and sinkholes, and is one of the most popular natural attractions in Puerto Rico. As of January 2019, the park is still closed for Hurricane Maria recovery.[10][11]

      <p id="GL468_410_002" num_links="2">The Glorieta gazebo in the center of the park, erected in 1911, still serves for weekly public concerts by the city's Philharmonic Band. North of the Glorieta is a bust of Leoncio Vidal, the War of Independence colonel who died on that spot fighting Spanish forces, and for whom the Park is named. Next to this bust is an obelisk, the first monument erected in the park, dedicated to the priest who migrated from the coastal town of <link wikipedia="Remedios,_Cuba" osm="482504736 5884800" type="node relation">Remedios</link> with other families and founded the city. Between these monuments is a statue of “el niño de la bota” (The Boy with the Leaking Boot), one of the symbols of the city.[2] This bronze statue depicts a boy with a leaking boot in his hand. The original base was changed to a more contemporary red granite in the 1960s, and remained that way until the 1990s when, in an effort to recover the original design, the city restored it to its original form; however, the use of cheap materials has corroded the base. South of that statue is another, a 1924 bronze statue of <link wikipedia="Marta_Abreu" osm="3477985399" type="node">Marta Abreu</link>, a local patron much loved by the people of Santa Clara. The base of her statue is said to be a time capsule, containing papers, magazines and objects collected during the construction and placed inside for future generations to find.

The church was destroyed by an earthquake in 1841, and again in 1910. It was then demolished in 1923, when Curridabat's resident priest, Anselmo Palacios, decided to construct a new church. He enlisted famed Costa Rican architect Teodorico Quirós to design the church, and it was completed in 1933. Today, it is a monument of immense historic value, though it is not National Patrimony because of contention regarding administration between the diocese and the government.
