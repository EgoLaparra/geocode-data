Babbitt as its postmaster.[2] With the increased need for agricultural workers which arose in the late 1920s, hundreds of farm workers migrated to the area in the 1930s. Many of those who settled in Randolph were black migrants from Oklahoma. This influx created a community which was predominantly Black.[3]:27 The post office closed in 1983.[3]:30 Today, Randolph is one of the few Black towns which exist in the United States.[3]:32

His daughter Sally Randolph inherited the house upon his death, at which time it became known as the Randolph Mansion, or Randolph House. The house was renamed Laurel Hill Mansion in 1976 by the City of Philadelphia during the United States Bicentennial. The central portion of the house was built around 1767 in the Georgian style and expanded in the early 19th century with a one-story addition on the south side. The octagonally-shaped Federal style addition on the north side was built in 1846.[2]

RandstadRail is a hybrid system of low-floor tram-train-like carriages used between The Hague and the city of Zoetermeer, and high-floor metro/subway-like carriages between The Hague and Rotterdam. The stations used by both lines have extended platforms with a high and a low part. Moreover, the network includes two bus lines.

The name can be somewhat confusing as for travellers RandstadRail only refers to tram 3 and 4 to Zoetermeer. All other connections as described above are fully integrated in existing metro and bus networks. On the other hand, Hague exploitant HTM considers a regular tram line as RandstadRail, only because it uses the RR-vehicles.[1]

In 1946, Henri Fleisch from Saint Joseph University made an unstratified, open-air survey of the marine terraces of Ras Beirut recovering various artifacts.[3] Flints have also been recovered by walkers on the nearby beaches.[4] The area is separated from the Sands of Beirut sites by the Wadi Abu Chahine or "South Creek" which begins south of the Continental Hotel area. It is an important site for Quaternary studies and has been published in various works by Fleisch, Auguste Bergy in 1932,[5] L. Dubertret in 1940 and 1948, Wright in 1960 and 1962,[6][7] Raoul Describes in 1921,[8] Dorothy Garrod in 1960 and R. Neuville in 1933.[9] Stratified sites are numbered in chronological order with unstratified sites at the end. The first four sites contain stratified Lower Paleolithic industries from the 45 metres (148 ft) beach level, the next five are stratified Middle Paleolithic with a gap in stratified sites to the Chalcolithic found at site XI. Intervening periods including the Levalloiso-Mousterian were well represented in surface finds along with a substantial amount of Neolithic material on a 45 metres (148 ft) terrace.

They belong to the end of Neolithic and early Eneolithic, or the period 4500-3500 BC, during the developed and ending phase of the Vinča culture when the first evidence of metallurgy appeared. The culture then disappears as the population presumably migrated. Both settlements were large, spreading on 40 to 60 ha (99 to 148 acres). Findings from the later Hallstatt culture were also discovered. The most important artifacts, kept in the People's Museum in Smederevska Palanka, are the anthropomorphic figurines of high artistic and artisan value. One of the most valuable and considered unique is the one called "Woman in labor", due to its contracted position. In total, there are over 1,000 figurines, some complete, some damaged, but it is estimated that at least 3,000 of them are in personal collections.[4]
