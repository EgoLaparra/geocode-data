Built between 1941 and 1953, it is the world's first all-welded bridge and is also the longest bridge in Kiev having a length of 1,543 metres (5,062 ft). Traffic across the bridge was opened on 5 November 1953. The bridge also acts as a segment of the Lesser Ring Road of Kiev.

</p>
      <p id="GL470_091_002" num_links="4">Engineer Evgeny Paton played a direct role in the design and construction of the bridge. Originally he came up with a revolutionary, even on a global scale, innovative idea of all-welding the structure instead of using the traditional riveted design. The first such road bridge in the world, the <link wikipedia="Maurzyce_Bridge" osm="54635202 463973536 6852000" type="way way relation">Maurzyce Bridge</link>, had been opened only in 1928 and since then the idea was a relative novelty in civil engineering, with only a couple dozen constructions finished before the outbreak of World War II. Paton urged the designers that such approach will greatly improve the reliability of the structure, but initially his idea did not find any support amongst the professionals. Eventually his idea of all-welding did receive the support, as he was given the go-head to start building the bridge by the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Nikita Khrushchev, who personally oversaw the entire operation. The construction of the first span began in early June 1941, but was interrupted by the Great Patriotic War. After the reconquering of <link wikipedia="Kiev" osm="26150422 421866" type="node relation">Kiev</link> by the Red Army on 6 November 1943, construction of the bridge was forced to begin practically from scratch as the retreating German troops blew up all of the existing parts of the incomplete bridge. However, the construction of the bridge was completed just in time for the 10th anniversary of the liberation of <link wikipedia="Kiev" osm="26150422 421866" type="node relation">Kiev</link> and was officially opened on the 5 November 1953. Upon the completion, the bridge was composed of 264 identical blocks which are 29 metres (95 ft) in length each, held together by welded seams totalling 10,668 metres (35,000 ft). The total weight of the entire structure is estimated to be over 10,000 tonnes (9,800 long tons; 11,000 short tons). The installation of the streetcar tracks on the bridge also enabled the passengers to commute between the Left Bank and Right Banks of <link wikipedia="Kiev" osm="26150422 421866" type="node relation">Kiev</link> by tram, taking pressure off the buses.

Patrick Henry is one of four high schools in Hanover County, and the only High school in the western half of the county.  In 1959, after years of deliberation, Patrick Henry High School began with the consolidation of Beaverdam, Henry Clay, Montpelier, and Rockville high schools. The western Hanover County high school enrolled students in grades eight through twelve. The name of the school, as well as the name of its literary publications, The Voice, The Spark, and The Orator, reference the history of Patrick Henry, Hanover County's most illustrious citizen. Even the school colors of red, white, and blue are a patriotic symbol of history. In 1969, Patrick Henry High and John M. Gandy High School merged to form one integrated student body. Also in 1969, a new junior high school was built, and Patrick Henry opened that school year as a senior high school serving students in grades ten through twelve. When the junior high school was changed to a middle school in 1988, Patrick Henry became a high school enrolling students in grades nine through twelve. The school campus of West Patrick Henry Road, which consists of a complex of buildings, began as a campus style school. Additions of an auditorium, classrooms, cafeteria, new gymnasium, and renovations to the media center and administrative offices resulted in an all-enclosed facility in 1992. As the population and the needs of the school have changed, so have the dimensions of the school. A new addition/renovation was added to the facility in the fall of 2001 providing state-of-the-art career and technical education opportunities. This addition consisted of a broadcasting studio, a bio-technology lab, a communication technology center, a computer-assisted drafting lab, and three classrooms. Patrick Henry celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 2009. Patrick Henry High has an International Baccalaureate program,[4] as well as a NJROTC program.[5]  Patrick Henry High is especially known for its NJROTC program that is consistently ranked among the top in the state of <link wikipedia="Virginia" osm="317004702 224042" type="node relation">Virginia</link>.

The bridge is a three-span cantilever with two anchor arms, two cantilever arms and a suspended section. It includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders. The bridge was designed by Homer M. Hadley, a consulting engineer from Washington State.[2]
The anchor arms and cantilever arms are multiple box, two-cell reinforced concrete box girders. The suspended section consists of two spread, welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck. The concrete deck is fixed to the top flange plate of the girders with steel shear developers. Utilization of this deck design allows the concrete deck and steel box girders to act in composite design; i.e., the bottom flange of the steel box resists tensile forces while the concrete deck resists compressive forces.[2]
The Patton Bridge's anchor arms are 115 feet (35 m) feet long, the cantilever arms are 50 feet (15 m) long, and the suspended span is 100 feet (30 m). The bridge has a total length of 430 feet (130 m). The center span of 200 feet (61 m) is the longest box girder span constructed in the state during the 1940s.[2]

In January 1628 he enrolled in the University of Wittenberg. There, two teachers in particular had an influence on him: Paul Röber and Jacob Martini. Both of these men were staunch Lutherans, promoting its teachings not only in the classroom but in sermons and hymns. Röber in particular often took his sermon texts from hymns. In this way Gerhardt was taught the use of hymnody as a tool of pastoral care and instruction.

His father, Eduard, a <link wikipedia="Hungary" osm="249399347 21335" type="node relation">Hungarian</link> of Jewish descent, taught music; his mother, Caroline Lauchheim, an <link wikipedia="Alsace" osm="1251610265 8636" type="node relation">Alsatian</link>, had been a private tutor for a baron. They met when Eduard was engaged to give Caroline's wards music lessons. Based in <link wikipedia="Vienna" osm="17328659 109166" type="node relation">Vienna</link>, Eduard Preuss and family (including two older sisters, Sophie and Mina) spent summers in Altaussee, following the migratory patterns of the vacationing Viennese upper class that employed him. As a boy, Preuss would often accompany his father, an amateur botanist, on his rambles throughout the local mountains of Altaussee. Never a robust child, at the age of six, Preuss was struck with a polio-like virus that left him partially paralyzed and confined to a bed or a wheelchair throughout that winter and spring. Once sufficiently recovered, the boy practiced gymnastic exercises and took walks to increase his strength. Though his father died when Preuss was in his tenth year, the latter continued the tradition of their mountain rambles, sometimes accompanied by his sisters or friends but often alone. At the age of eleven, he began pursuing summits in earnest, inaugurating his career as a mountaineer. Later, as his interest in alpinism intensified, he would train by placing inverted glasses on top of a wardrobe and doing pull-ups on these unstable supports – excellent practice for loose rock. One-armed pull-ups also became part of his routine (though apparently not on a glass).
Following in the footsteps of his father's avocation, after high school Preuss studied plant physiology at the <link wikipedia="University_of_Vienna" osm="1441683" type="relation">University of Vienna</link> and was awarded a doctoral degree at Munich University in 1911.

However, it was the first school of Northern Baden to continue teaching. As there were not enough boarding school pupils, the boarding school was closed in the 80s, but the day school has been continued and expanded. Today approx. 750 Catholic and Protestant pupils attend this school. It offers a new and old language stream covering Latin, English, French and Ancient Greek.

Rising approximately 300 feet (91 m) above the surrounding plains, the buttes are erosional remnants left standing in isolation as the surrounding High Plains surface has gradually worn away.  The lower portions of the buttes are composed of relatively soft, clay-rich sedimentary rock called the Brule formation.  The Brule formation is protected by an overlying layer of sandstone and conglomerate sediments called the Arikaree formation, which are more resistant to weathering.[1]
