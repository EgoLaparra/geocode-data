The residence was known for its remarkable fine arts collection, including paintings by da Vinci, Caravaggio, Rubens and del Sarto. The palace belonged to the Tyszkiewicz family until the end of World War I, when it was converted into a shelter for children. It suffered damage during World War II and was rebuilt only in 1959–1973.  Currently it houses collections devoted to the Tyszkiewicz family and Juozas Naujalis.

The mainline station was originally known as Ravenglass before being lengthened to Ravenglass for Eskdale. It was then renamed to Ravenglass on 6 May 1974.[1] When First North Western operated the station during the early part of the 21st century, it reverted to its name of Ravenglass for Eskdale until Northern rebranded the station signage in 2007, losing the "for Eskdale" suffix once more.

Patrick Ross, a franchisee of multiple restaurant chains including Wendy's, Ponderosa Steak House, and Long John Silver's. RAC purchased the remainder of RIX from General Foods, and returned the JAX name to the restaurants.  RAC eventually decided to focus on the roast beef business, and began franchising the chain.

Vendor stalls occupy the ground floor with entrances on Filbert Street to the South, Twelfth Street to the West, and Arch Street to the North. The stalls are arranged in a grid pattern with an open area in the center with tables and seating. Over one hundred merchants offer fresh produce, meats, fish, artisan cheese, groceries, ice cream, flowers, grilled cheese, baked goods, crafts, books, clothing, and specialty and ethnic foods.[1] Two of the vendors are descendants of original merchants from the initial opening in the late 1800s.[2] The basement floor of the market holds the state-of-the-art refrigerated storage area for vendor use. Currently, the market is open every day of the week, although the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants (a small but significant minority) generally do not operate Sunday through Tuesday.
