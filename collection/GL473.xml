The Pendleton facility currently offers maximum and minimum-security housing for adult males over 22 years old.

In 1897, due to the belief that young male offenders should not be housed with their older counterparts, inmates were divided by age between the South and North. The Indiana State Prison South became home to inmates age 16 to 30 and the prison was renamed the Indiana Reformatory.

      <p id="GL473_078_002" num_links="4">Until the Middle Ages, Peniche was an island. However, siltation of the channel between the island and the community of <link wikipedia="Atouguia_da_Baleia" osm="6548050" type="relation">Atouguia</link> on the mainland, caused by sea currents and winds, eventually led to the sea being replaced by sand dunes, with Peniche becoming a peninsula. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries the area was the target of attacks by English, French and Barbary pirates, to which <link wikipedia="Manuel_I_of_Portugal" osm="4345171818" type="node">King Manuel I</link> initially responded by installing four armed ships in Peniche. He also encouraged the idea of a permanent fortification on that part of the coast. In 1544, King John III recommended the construction of a castle on the peninsula and in the same year the most appropriate location to give protection to the town’s harbour was identified. Initial construction work was mainly carried out in 1557 and 1558 but work on the northeast and northwest walls continued until 1567. The design is believed to have been influenced by the castles built by Henry VIII of England, most notably <link wikipedia="Pendennis_Castle" osm="865125078" type="node">Pendennis Castle</link> in <link wikipedia="Falmouth,_Cornwall" osm="29285363" type="node">Falmouth</link>.[1][2]

The surrounding countryside is predominantly rural with farming on rich well-watered soil on mainly gentle slopes rising to the bleak moorland to the west of the town. Dry stone walls, small hamlets and farms surrounded by fields and livestock are synonymous with the area. The area is known for its rugged breed of sheep, the Whitefaced Woodland. The market town itself stands at its highest point around St Johns Church at around 250 m (820 ft) above sea level. However, the surrounding land rises well over 1,000 ft (300 m) towards Cubley and Thurlstone Moors and out towards smaller hamlets at Carlecotes, Victoria, Dunford, and Crow Edge, elevated at points above 1,200 ft (370 m).

The mill serves as a training mill for the Gild Fryske Mounders (English: Guild of Frisian Millers').[3] On 7 July 2000, the mill was dressed overall in the Zaanse style, in celebration of its Zaan origins and the centenary of its erection in Joure.[4]
A further restoration of the mill was undertaken in 2007. The stage was rebuilt, and the cap removed from the mill to allow it to be completely rethatched.[2]

Little is known about the history of the stones. They are believed to be between 3,500 and 4,000 years old and are a Scheduled ancient monument.[1] The exposed part of each stone is about 3 m (10 ft) high and 1 m (3 ft) broad at the base, but only about 20 cm (8 in) thick. They are situated about 3 m (10 ft) apart on an open grassy place above Porth Dafarch between two low hills. They are aligned along their long axes in a northeasterly/southwesterly direction, with a fine view of the coast and towards Holyhead Mountain. There are theories that they may have formed part of a stone circle, however there is no evidence to support this. It is also said that there was previously a stone cist between them, but again this story lacks supporting evidence.[2] There may be some significance to the fact that they are located just 100 m (328 ft) from the Plas Meilw hut circle but their presence here is "quite enigmatic".[1]

Orange Township was the birthplace of President James A. Garfield in 1831. By the late 1880s, dairy farming and cheese production became the primary industry of the township.[7] In 1924, residents of the northwestern quadrant of Orange Township voted to separate, and the village of Pepper Pike was incorporated. The name "Pepper Pike" was supposedly selected after the Pepper family, who lived and worked along the primary transportation corridor (i.e., turnpike). Incorporated as a city in 1970, Pepper Pike operates under the mayor-council form of government. In the late 2000s, it was chosen as one of the top seven strangest city names by the World Book of Facts.

The suburb was named after its trademark "Peppermint trees" (Agonis flexuosa) lining many streets. The suburb has long been associated with Western Australia's wealthiest and oldest families: see Robert Pascoe's "Peppermint Grove: Western Australia's Capital Suburb". Their prosperity is reflected in historic houses in the area, such as 'St Just' and The Cliffe. Peppermint Grove remains, to this day, the suburb with the highest average weekly income in Western Australia.[4] Its Sydney and Melbourne equivalents, as Pascoe points out, would be <link wikipedia="Vaucluse,_New_South_Wales" osm="5710429" type="relation">Vaucluse</link> and <link wikipedia="Toorak,_Victoria" osm="2384455" type="relation">Toorak</link>.
