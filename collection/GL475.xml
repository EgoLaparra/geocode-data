</p>
      <p id="GL475_051_002" num_links="2">The ribat is located on the Ponta da Atalaia, about 1 km north of Arrifana Beach. It was constructed around 1130, probably by the Sufi and Mahdi master of Christian origin, Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi, one of the leading political and religious figures in al-Andalus, the Muslim territory that covered most of <link wikipedia="Iberian_Peninsula" osm="3870917" type="relation">Iberia</link> during the Islamic Golden Age. Between 1130 and 1140 Ibn Qasi wrote his main work, The Removal of the Sandals, which was inspired by both the Old Testament and the Quran. In 1151 he was assassinated in <link wikipedia="Silves,_Portugal" osm="5404107" type="relation">Silves</link> after being accused of betraying Islam by the followers of Abd al-Mu'min and Ibn Almúndir. After this the Ribat of Arrifana was abandoned, with the English crusader and chronicler, Roger of Hoveden, reporting forty years later that it was “recognizable but in ruins”. It is believed that the minaret was used as a watchtower in the fourteenth century. Despite appearing in written records dating back to 1786 and being clearly identifiable as a former inhabited area as late as 1841,[1] the location of the ribat was only identified by archaeologists at the beginning of this millennium. Its architectural features are inspired by the ribats identified in North Africa.[2]

      <p id="GL475_053_002" num_links="2">The ribat was initially constructed by the Aghlabid ruler Ibrahim the Great in the 8th century. During this time, the building had a modest structure. It was restored during the rule of Ziyadullah in 821, who ordered a major expansion of the fort. During the restoration, two floors, basement and battlements were added, as well as thirty rooms for guards to live complete with bathroom and toilet. A mosque was also established on the terrace where used by the citizens of Sousse especially during the Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha. It is considered among the first mosques built in the city, including the <link wikipedia="Great_Mosque_of_Sousse" osm="1385664" type="relation">Great Mosque of Sousse</link>. The ribat is also equipped with a water basin which collects rainwater for the use of drinking and washing. The basin was first built by Ibrahim the Great, which was expanded later by Ziyadullah. The ribat was built less than 10 years later than the <link wikipedia="Ribat_of_Monastir" osm="2935194780 1388014" type="node relation">Ribat of Monastir</link>, which was first-built in 796.

      <p id="GL475_064_002" num_links="2">Ribe is Denmark's oldest surviving city. Ribe began as an open trading market on the north bank of the Ribe River where it runs into the <link wikipedia="North_Sea" osm="9051063" type="relation">North Sea</link>.  Danes, Norwegians, Swedes, Germans, Frisians, English and other cultures occasionally brought exchange goods here from all parts of northwestern Europe. The landscape around Ribe is flat, wind-blown and sandy, without any particular natural harbour, but in former times, boats could enter the river from the sea and reach the town. By the late Medieval period, the natural sedimentation processes of the <link wikipedia="Wadden_Sea" osm="4805502333 5909371" type="node relation">Wadden Sea</link> had closed that option. Ribe Market was sanctioned by either King Angantyr (Ongendus) or King Harald Hildetand as early as 705. In the Viking Era, Ribe was a bustling international trade center, making it an ideal starting point for Christian missionaries from Hamburg to initiate the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia.

      <p id="GL475_135_001" num_links="4">Ribolla Gialla (also known as Ribolla, in Slovenian: Rumena rebula, in Croatian: Jarbola) is a white Italian wine grape grown most prominently in the Friuli region of northeast Italy. The grape is also found in <link wikipedia="Slovenia" osm="208592566 218657" type="node relation">Slovenia</link> where it is known as Rebula. In Friuli, the grape thrives in the region around <link wikipedia="Corno_di_Rosazzo" osm="179150" type="relation">Rosazzo</link> and <link wikipedia="Gorizia" osm="66502654 179075" type="node relation">Gorizia</link>. In Slovenia, the grape is grown prominently in the <link wikipedia="Municipality_of_Brda" osm="1675784" type="relation">Brda</link> region.[1] The grape is not related to the Friuli red wine grape Schioppettino, which is also known as Ribolla Nera. The obscure, lower quality Ribola Verde grape is a mutated version that is not widely used.[2]

</p>
      <p id="GL475_135_002" num_links="3">Theories that the grape originated in Greece as Robola[1] were disproved following DNA profiling in 2007 and 2008, which showed there was no genetic relationship between Robola and Ribolla Gialla.[3]. It is now thought to have originated in the Friuli Collio/Goriska Brda region.[4] The first written documentation of the grape was in a 1289 notarial contract on vineyard land in the Friuli region. During the 14th century, the <link wikipedia="Italy" osm="26347360 365331" type="node relation">Italian</link> poet Giovanni Boccaccio listed indulgence of Ribolla wines as one of the sins of gluttony in his diatribe on the subject. When the Duke of Austria, Leopold III, established reign over <link wikipedia="Trieste" osm="66502648 179180" type="node relation">Trieste</link> one of his stipulations was that the city supply him each year with 100 urns of the region's best Ribolla wine.[5] By 1402, the reputation of the wine made from the grape was high enough for the city of <link wikipedia="Udine" osm="66502664 179272" type="node relation">Udine</link> to feel compelled to enact a law which prohibited the adulteration of any wine made from Ribolla. In the 18th century, the Italian writer Antonio Musnig rated Ribolla wine as the finest white wine in the Friuli.[citation needed] The phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century took a hard toll on Ribolla plantings with many Friuli vineyards owners choosing to replant their land with imported French wine grapes like Merlot and Sauvignon blanc rather than the local grape varieties. By the 1990s less than 1% of all white Friuli wines created under a Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) designation contained Ribolla. By the turn of the 21st century, international interest in the wines of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia had led to an increase in plantings of the grape.[2] Today it has a more prominent roles in the white DOC wines of Colli Orientali del Friuli and Collio Goriziano.[6]

It was completed in 1913 on the site of the former Capitol building of the Republic of Texas, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The old Capitol building was operated as a hotel until it was torn down and replaced by a new hotel around 1881. Jesse H. Jones built a new seventeen-story, double-winged hotel in 1913, also  called "The Rice Hotel." This building underwent major expansions: adding a third wing in 1925, adding an eighteenth floor in 1951, and adding a five-story "motor lobby in 1958. In addition, there were several renovations during its life as a hotel. It continued to operate as a hotel before finally shutting down in 1977. The Rice, renamed the Post Rice Lofts, was renovated and turned into apartments in 1998 after twenty-one years of standing unused.

In addition to hiring a company to manage "turnaround", the NYCDOE planned to develop a new school at the site called the 21st Century School of Richmond Hill to improve the school. The new school would have a literacy and technology focus designed to interest students in internet based academic work.

The main body of the building dates back to 1880, with later additions built in 1932 and in 1957. The United Church boasts a history of over 200 years, where it began as a simple log schoolhouse that acted as a place of worship for the local Methodists. Later a frame building was constructed in 1847 as a replacement but this structure did not survive: in 1879 it burned down to the ground. Five months later, in 1880, work began on what was to be the last building. The church was designed by Charles Walton, a <link wikipedia="Toronto" osm="18063533 324211" type="node relation">Toronto</link> architect. Construction was carried out for a year until the church was completed in 1881. In its time, the church cost $17,000 to be built, which was a very significant figure, and the property was purchased for $950 as a deed. During those times the church was large enough to accommodate everyone who lived in the area together. Originally the Methodist Church, it was renamed the United Church in 1925 when the Methodists, the Congregationalists, and the Presbyterians entered into a union.

      <p id="GL475_413_002" num_links="2">Ricketts Glen's land was once home to Native Americans. From 1822 to 1827, a turnpike was built along the course of PA 487 in what is now the park, where two squatters harvested cherry trees to make bed frames from about 1830 to 1860. The park's waterfalls were one of the main attractions for a hotel from 1873 to 1903; the park is named for the hotel's proprietor, R. Bruce Ricketts, who built the trail along the waterfalls.  By the 1890s Ricketts owned or controlled over 80,000 acres (320 km2; 120 sq mi) and made his fortune clearcutting almost all of that land, including much of what is now the park; however he preserved about 2,000 acres (810 ha) of virgin forest in the creek's three glens. The sawmill was at the village of <link wikipedia="Ricketts,_Pennsylvania" osm="158520619" type="node">Ricketts</link>, which was mostly north of the park.
