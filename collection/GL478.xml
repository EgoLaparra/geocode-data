Originally it entered the tidal River Humber at Pyewipe, north west of Grimsby, but has been re-routed and now supplies Grimsby Docks.
There was an existing haven within the borough of Grimsby but this suffered greatly with silting problems so in 1669 landowners agreed to the diversion of the Freshney through the town to the haven to provide fresh water and improve the flow. It is believed the work was completed in the very early 18th century.

Its valley creates a long chain of marshy ground along its lower length, much of which has been used for gravel and mineral extraction, reservoirs and industry. Much of the river has been canalised to provide a navigable route for boats into eastern Hertfordshire, known as the Lee Navigation. While the lower Lea remains somewhat polluted, its upper stretch and tributaries, classified as chalk streams, are a major source of drinking water for London.

The river was made navigable from its mouth to Narborough and probably to <link wikipedia="West_Acre" osm="29808921" type="node">West Acre</link> as a result of an Act of Parliament obtained in 1751.

In 1884, the river was taken over by the River Nar Drainage Board, and closed to navigation, when an un-navigable sluice was constructed to the south of a Manure Factory in King's Lynn. A new sluice very close to the junction with the Great Ouse has been built more recently.

There were at least seven corn mills in the 1880s, and the last one remained operational until 1966. The middle section of the river crosses Baggy Moor, where major improvements were made in 1777 to drain the moor. The scheme was one of the largest to enclose and improve land in North Shropshire, and the quality of the reclaimed land justified the high cost.

Prior to 1287, its mouth was further to the east at <link wikipedia="New_Romney" osm="28257611" type="node">New Romney</link>, but it changed its course after a great storm blocked its exit to the sea. It was known as the Limen until the sixteenth century. For the final 14 miles (23 km), the river bed is below the high tide level, and Scots Float sluice is used to control levels. It prevents salt water entering the river system at high tides, and retains water in the river during the summer months to ensure the health of the surrounding marsh habitat. Below the sluice, the river is tidal for 3.7 miles (6.0 km).

It flowed in a loop around the northern edge of the Isle of Oxney until 1635, when it was diverted along the southern edge. Scots Float Sluice was built before 1723, when the engineer John Reynolds made repairs to it, and later extended it, to try to keep the channel clear of silting, but it was criticised by John Rennie in 1804, as it was inconvenient to shipping. The river became part of a defensive line to protect England from the threat of invasion by the French in the early 1800s, when its lower section and part of the <link wikipedia="River_Brede" osm="4252463" type="relation">River Brede</link> formed a link between the two halves of the Royal Military Canal. Scots Float Sluice was again rebuilt in 1844. Some 31 square miles (80 km2) of the valley were inundated by floodwater in 1960, which resulted in the Rother Area Drainage Improvement Scheme being implemented between 1966 and 1980. The river banks were raised, and 20 pumping stations were installed.

The community of <link wikipedia="Dunthorpe,_Oregon" osm="150980845" type="node">Dunthorpe</link>, which was historically anchored by Riverdale grade school, faced changes in 1991, when Oregon Senate Bill 917 decreed that all school districts should have both primary and secondary schools, and expected smaller school districts like Riverdale to merge.

Riverdale chose to keep its independence (and became the only previously K-8 district in Oregon to do so). The community purchased an old grade school, the former Collins View School in southwest Portland, which was built in the mid-1930s and closed in 1976.

The property contained two lakes that were spring-fed and home to numerous waterfowl. However, development did not begin until years later when the land was  donated to the city. Some time after 1890, a carriage lane and walking paths were created, stone bridges were constructed, and ornamentals were planted, including camphor trees. By 1907, it was one of the prettiest parks in the southern U.S. with picture postcards capturing the beauty. Tennis courts and a bandstand were built, attracting even more people to the park's natural features. When Margaret Street was laid out, it cut off the southwest corner of the park, and the north side of the property was used by <link wikipedia="Interstate_95" osm="331325" type="relation">Interstate 95</link>, reducing the parcel to its current 11.4 acres.

      <p id="GL478_480_002" num_links="2">Riverton was founded by John Taylor in 1837. Originally named Judy's Ferry for the ferry crossing the Sangamon River there, then Jamestown, after politician James Shields, the village was successful for about a decade, producing lumber for a planned railroad. When it was discovered that the railroad was badly constructed and unreliable, Jamestown fell into economic distress and the land on which it sat was sold.
The town was sold to Joseph Loose of <link wikipedia="Maryland" osm="316964668 162112" type="node relation">Maryland</link>, then again to John D. Keedy, a Springfield distiller. Land south of Jamestown was purchased and a distillery was put up. Yet again, the properties were lost, first mortgaged to Jacob Bunn, then given as a claim settlement to Parley L. Howlett, another distiller.
Jamestown was soon renamed Howlett, Shields had fallen from popularity, and a new flour mill and coal mine caused a short-lived boom. Despite their success, most of Howlett was sold to Jacob Bunn to pay off debt. Bunn started selling the lots to the residents, the only owner to do so. After a state requirement was passed preventing communities from being named after people, Howlett was rechristened as Riverton in the 1870s.
In 1876, train robber Jesse James spent a night in Riverton while en route to a bank heist in <link wikipedia="Minnesota" osm="316967611 165471" type="node relation">Minnesota</link>. Al Capone also reportedly used Riverton as one of his hideouts.

The depot was built by the Chicago and North Western Railway from 1906 to 1907 along a new line through central Wyoming built by the railway in 1906. The city of Riverton formed only two weeks before the railroad reached it when land in the area opened to new residents under the Homestead Act. The railroad spurred economic development in the region by exporting agricultural products and oil and creating demand for the local coal and lumber industries. When the railroad industry declined after <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>, the Chicago and North Western gradually decreased its service west of <link wikipedia="Casper,_Wyoming" osm="151700975 252231" type="node relation">Casper</link>, and by 1974 it was prepared to demolish the Riverton station as well. A group of Riverton residents instead bought and restored the depot, which now houses businesses. The depot is the last surviving Chicago and North Western station west of Casper.[2]
