Pilot Butte itself is a popular hiking destination with two trails to the summit, each gaining about 490 feet (150 m) in elevation. There is also a 1.8 mile trail around the base of Pilot Butte that was constructed in 2010. A scenic road also winds up and around the cone. The park had 881,722 annual visits as reported on the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department website in 2014 making it the most visited Oregon State Park east of the Cascade Mountains.[citation needed] From the top, the entire city of Bend is visible, as well as several major Cascade peaks.

The Clark wagon train approached the area from the east after recovering from the Clark Massacre.

The lake was formerly a widened region of Snapfinger Creek, and the valley that encompasses much of the town was where corn was grown. The lake was dammed by the Army Corps of Engineers as erosion and flood control, prior to the official FDR lake projects.
