The reservoir is named after the naturally formed circular valley surrounded by <link wikipedia="Cushetunk_Mountain" osm="357720491" type="node">Cushetunk Mountain</link>. The  deep valley was caused by erosion of the soft sedimentary rock.

The park also has a wilderness area for camping, swimming and SCUBA diving facilities, a boat ramp and nature hiking and biking trails. The reservoir has been called the Bermuda Triangle of New Jersey, and over 26 people have drowned there since 1971. Six of them have never been found.[1][2]

The Roxy was the first building in Saskatoon with air conditioning. It was built for sound pictures.  The New York Roxy, largest cinema ever built in North America (demolished 1960) named after its manager noted radio personality and impresario "Roxy" Rothafel, spawned hundreds of unrelated theatres across North America named Roxy, since the word came to mean the latest and best in showmanship.

</p>
      <p id="GL485_422_002" num_links="8">The Royal Armoury was founded by Charles Albert, king of Sardinia, and opened to the public in 1837. Since then it has been housed in the Galleria Beaumont, built on the site of a previous gallery connecting the Royal Palace to <link wikipedia="Palazzo_Madama,_Turin" osm="2579573" type="relation">Palazzo Madama</link>. Designed by Filippo Juvarra in 1733, it was decorated by the court painter Claudio Francesco Beaumont (hence its name) in 1738-1743, whose oil paintings on the ceiling depict Stories of Aeneas. The gallery was completed after 1762 by Benedetto Alfieri, who also designed the nearby stairway as an access to the State offices (Segreterie di Stato).
Until 1832, several large paintings from the royal collections were displayed on the walls of this gallery. The paintings were then moved to <link wikipedia="Palazzo_Madama,_Turin" osm="2579573" type="relation">Palazzo Madama</link>, the first seat of the public collection called Reale Galleria (now <link wikipedia="Sabauda_Gallery" osm="246516619" type="node">Sabauda Gallery</link>). King Charles Albert decided to place his collection of arms and armour inside this gallery; most of them came from <link wikipedia="Turin" osm="63621589 43992" type="node relation">Turin</link>’s and <link wikipedia="Genoa" osm="66586322 44875" type="node relation">Genoa</link>’s arsenals, as well as from the museums housed since the 18th century in the Palazzo dell’Università. The royal collection included prehistoric and medieval objects, weapons and armour used by the dukes (later kings) of Savoy, but also many prestigious diplomatic gifts. Charles Albert enriched such collection through the acquisition of single pieces on the market (mainly in Paris) and of whole private collections, such as the one formed by the set designer Alessandro Sanquirico in Milan (1833) and the Martinengo della Fabbrica collection from Brescia (1839).
In 1836, the king asked Pelagio Palagi to redesign an adjacent room in order to make it the seat of the Medagliere, i.e. a large collection of medals, coins and seals. The room’s Greek-style furniture was specifically meant to preserve and display this collection, as well as antiques and other precious objects belonging to the royal family.  The Medagliere was closely connected with the <link wikipedia="Royal_Library_of_Turin" osm="4849156539" type="node">Royal Library</link> still housed on the ground floor.
Palagi also designed the so-called Rotonda at the other end of the Galleria Beaumont, on the site of a former theatre (later ballroom) once connected to <link wikipedia="Palazzo_Madama,_Turin" osm="2579573" type="relation">Palazzo Madama</link> through a further gallery which was demolished in 1809. The Rotonda became an extension of the original Armoury: arms, flags and other objects connected with the military history of the kingdom of Sardinia after the 18th century were then displayed in showcases in this room. The collection includes weapons formerly owned by <link wikipedia="Napoleon" osm="1929326309 3442691028" type="node node">Napoleon</link> and by the kings of Italy, since the Savoy family gained that title after the unification of the country in 1861. European and American swords, guns and rifles are now displayed alongside oriental arms and armour acquired by or donated to the kings.
