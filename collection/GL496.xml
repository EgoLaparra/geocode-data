The manor house passed through several owners, including the Stanfords—reputedly the richest family in Sussex[1]— after several centuries of ownership by the Diocese of Chichester and a period in which it was Crown property.

As a result of the Peace of Pressburg, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, and Emperor Francis II proclaimed himself Emperor Francis I of Austria; this is commemorated today by a Roman-style bust of the Emperor on the staircase next to the Hall of Mirrors.

The village is located in the area around Greenville Road and Providence Pike.  The village takes its name from the Primrose railroad station which existed on Greenville Road for the Providence and Springfield Railroad which began service in 1873.  The Primrose Fire Department and North Smithfield High School are located in the area. The historic Primrose Grange (1887) building is located on Grange Road as well as several eighteenth-century farms surrounded by stonewalls.[1]

      <p id="GL496_291_002" num_links="2">The geography of Primrose was drastically changed by the Wisconsin glaciation between 70,000 and 10,000 years ago. This glaciation or "Ice Age" created a more rugged terrain, and deposited granite throughout the landscape. As a result of this rugged terrain, this area has many peaks and valleys, which leads to many wetlands. This area is less built up than the other villages in <link wikipedia="North_Smithfield,_Rhode_Island" osm="158816155" type="node">North Smithfield</link>, partly because of the geography, and partly because the area is not part of the mill village of <link wikipedia="Slatersville,_Rhode_Island" osm="158860266" type="node">Slatersville</link>.

Despite the island's size, it was not discovered until 1932, when the tug captain W. A. Poole first sighted it. His information never made it onto any published map.[1] It was rediscovered in 1948 by Albert-Ernest Tomkinson navigating an Avro Lancaster for the RCAF 408 (Photo) Squadron,[1] though it was likely known to the local Inuit long before that. The island was named for Prince Charles, who was born the same year. The island is uninhabited and its temperatures are extremely cold.[citation needed]

He became Duke of Cambridge in 1850 and field marshal in 1862.  Deeply devoted to the old Army, he worked with <link wikipedia="Queen_Victoria" osm="309495043" type="way">Queen Victoria</link> to defeat or minimize every reform proposal, such as setting up a general staff.

These thick glaciers are held in place by coastal mountain ranges.  On the Princess Astrid Coast, some of the ice does flow through the mountains, spilling onto the relatively flat land on the Princess Astrid Coast. Also, the cold air spills over the mountains, creating very strong and persistent winds, which makes the snow scour off the tops of the glaciers leaving pale blue patches of bare ice. On top of the coastal line is the ice shelf, which is much smoother. The glacial ice floats on the sea surface which is beyond the chaotic surface of the sea ice which has been solidifying all winter long.[2]
