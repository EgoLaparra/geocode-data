It was originally dedicated to Abu Kir and Yohanna (or Ss. Cyrus and John). When the remains of St. Barbara were brought here, a separate sanctuary was built. Thus, there are now two separate churches that were built on this location.[1] Athanasius, a wealthy scribe and a secretary of Abdel-Aziz Ibn Marwan (governor of Egypt between 685 and 705 AD), had built the Church. A door found during one of the church's many restorations could date as early as the 4th Century. Between 1072 and 1073, the Church was fully restored to house the relics of Saint Barbara. These relics remain to this day. The Church was damaged again by another fire during the 12th century. In fact, the church was renovated as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, when the khurus, a transverse room preceding the sanctuary, was sacrificed in order to allow more space.[2]

Its full name, “Pontifical and Royal Sacramental Arch-confraternity of St Peter, St Andrew, St Isidore and of the Immaculate Conception” reveals its origins: the arch-confraternity resulted from the 1587 merger of the confraternities of the parishes of St Peter the Royal, St Andrew the apostle, the Immaculate Conception and St Isidore the Labourer. All these fraternities included among their duties the dignified burial of deceased members, for which purpose a request was made to open a cemetery in what was then the outskirts of Madrid, near the hermitage of St Isidore.

</p>
      <p id="GL498_269_002" num_links="5">The parish's 5 mile coastline is one of the most impressive and varied in the federation. The northern coasts consist of long beaches with black volcanic sand. Large offshore reef formations almost completely surround Dieppe Bay Beach, creating the island's safest natural harbour. The other beaches, namely Parson's Beach and Sandy Bay, however, lack this protection and are battered by the turbulent waves of the Atlantic Ocean. The southern coasts contain one of the island's most noted natural features, Black Rocks. Stretching for almost 2 miles, these large metamorphic rock projections are the result of St. Kitts' last volcanic eruption (estimated to be in the 14th century) when lava poured down the slopes of <link wikipedia="Mount_Liamuiga" osm="4008434281" type="node">Mount Liamuiga</link> creeping until it met the Atlantic Ocean, where it cooled and hardened. Shaped and formed by wave action over the years, the many grottoes, pools and projections that now line the area are a testament to the island's volcanicity. Saint John Capisterre is also home to the tallest peak in the Leeward Islands, <link wikipedia="Mount_Liamuiga" osm="4008434281" type="node">Mount Liamuiga</link>, whose crater lake marks the boundary for <link wikipedia="Saint_Paul_Capisterre" osm="4008356285" type="node">Saint Paul Capisterre</link>, <link wikipedia="Saint_Anne_Sandy_Point_Parish" osm="9280612" type="relation">Saint Anne Sandy Point</link> and <link wikipedia="Saint_Thomas_Middle_Island_Parish" osm="9280613" type="relation">Saint Thomas Middle Island</link>.

Below 1000 feet, the forests give way to small farm holdings and abandoned sugar cane estates. The parish is a main producer for tropical fruit on the island.

The first church was built on the northeast corner of North Pearl Street and Lumber Street (today Livingston Avenue). Built in 1842 and dedicated in 1843 at a cost of $28,000, it soon became too small for the growing congregation. The second structure built was at the current site along Ten Broeck Street between First Street and Second Street, purchased for $45,000. Patrick Keely was the architect, who had also designed the <link wikipedia="Cathedral_of_the_Immaculate_Conception_(Albany,_New_York)" osm="90702210" type="way">Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception</link>. Ground was broken in 1855, the cornerstone laid in 1856, and completed in 1860 at a cost of approximately $250,000. In attendance at the dedication were all the bishops in the ecclesiastical Province of New York including the Bishop of Albany and the Archbishop of New York, the Bishop of Boston, and the Bishop of Newfoundland. The limestone exterior was originally trimmed with Caen stone but that type of limestone did not weather well and so was replaced with Ohio sandstone in 1866. Around 1874 the original church was sold to a bakery and in 1876 the church congregation incorporated.[1]

Since then, it became the unofficial university chapel. The parish was officially established under the Archdiocese of Lipa in 1958. It serves the spiritual needs of the former parishioners of the Immaculate Conception Parish living around the University of the Philippines <link wikipedia="University_of_the_Philippines_Los_Baños_College_of_Agriculture_and_Food_Science" osm="227117663 965400 3018367" type="way relation relation">College of Agriculture</link> and <link wikipedia="University_of_the_Philippines_Los_Baños_College_of_Forestry_and_Natural_Resources" osm="226828346" type="way">College of Forestry</link>. The first parish priest was Father John Hurley.   Due to lack of priests, the parish was administered by priests from the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) for 33 years.[3] The present church with a seating capacity of 1,500 was built and blessed in 1971. In 2000, the secular priests took charge of the parish with Monsignor Bernardino Cortez and Father Gabriel Ma. Delfino as parish priest and assistant parish priest respectively. When Monsignor Cortez was appointed as Auxiliary Bishop of <link wikipedia="Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Manila" osm="89184388 9388279" type="way relation">Manila</link>, Monsignor James Contreras succeeded as parish priest.
