The struggle to keep the church free of sand lasted until 1795, when it was abandoned.[1][2] The church was demolished, leaving the tower with crow-stepped gable as the only part of the original structure still standing.

The farmable acres in this area are some of the richest, most productive soils in the county; however much of the land is suitable only for grazing due to the terrain. There is a family-owned reservoir that is open to the public for fishing. The economy is supported by recreation -there is excellent hunting, fishing, and camping opportunities available all year round.  Just check in at the Fish, Wildlife, and Parks station located in the center of town.  There is a General Store attached to the Post Office.  It has lunch available that you can eat at a picnic table.  People are allowed to camp behind it.  There is a church that has a service every other Sunday.

A sandcastle-shaped peninsula was created by humans; the surface is about 1 km². It is expected that this sand is then moved over the years by the action of waves, wind and currents along the coast. To protect the West of the Netherlands against the sea, the beaches along the coast are artificially replenished every five years, and it is expected that the sandcastle will make replenishment along the Delfland Coast unnecessary for the next 20 years. This method is expected to be more cost effective and also helps nature by reducing the repeated disruption caused by replenishment.[1]

It is a grade I listed[1] 1920s decorated chapel, designed by Lionel Godfrey Pearson. The chapel was built to accommodate a series of paintings by the English artist Stanley Spencer. It was commissioned by Mary and Louis Behrend (1881–1972) as a memorial to Mary's brother, Lieutenant Henry Willoughby Sandham who died at the end of the First World War.

</p>
      <p id="GL505_152_002" num_links="2">Spencer's series of 17 paintings was inspired by his own experiences during the First World War, in which he served as an orderly with the Royal Army Medical Corps, first at Beaufort War Hospital in Bristol, and then in Macedonia, where he was subsequently transferred to the infantry. He was influenced by Giotto’s <link wikipedia="Scrovegni_Chapel" osm="131997214" type="way">Arena Chapel</link> murals in <link wikipedia="Padua" osm="406747508 44836" type="node relation">Padua</link>. He wanted to paint murals too, but the environmental conditions were not appropriate. The subsequent paintings were commissioned in 1923, with Spencer moving to Burghclere in 1926 to work in-situ. The series was completed in 1932. It is dominated by the Resurrection scene behind the altar, in which dozens of British soldiers lay the white wooden crosses that marked their graves at the feet of a distant Christ. The series chronicles Spencer's everyday experiences of the war rather than any scenes of action. When the art historian R. H. Wilenski saw the recently completed sequence, he wrote of his sense "that every one of the thousand memories recorded had been driven into the artist's consciousness like a sharp-pointed nail".[3]

A railway line was opened for goods between Moorswater and Looe on 27 December 1860 and the canal went into gradual decline finally closing in 1910.[5]

It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the Weymouth Bay anchorage. The stone castle had an octagonal gun platform, linked to a residential blockhouse, and was completed by 1542 at a cost of £3,887. Earthwork defences were built around the landward side of the castle, probably in 1623. Sandsfoot saw service during the English Civil War, when it was held by Parliament and Royalists in turn during the conflict. It survived the interregnum but, following Charles II's restoration to the throne, the fortress was withdrawn from military use in 1665.
