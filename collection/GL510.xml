The current hill, about 46 metres (151 ft) above sea level and about 40 metres (130 ft) above the Neman, is a remnant of the larger hill that was destroyed by erosion. The hill was known as sacred among locals and played a role in the ceremonies of pagan Lithuanians. It is featured in many local legends and is protected by the state as a mythological object. A large stone at the top of the hill, known as the altar stone, was destroyed by a miller in 1811. Rambynas became popular with Prussian Lithuanians at the end of the 19th century who organized various events, most notably celebrations of the Saint Jonas' Festivals or Rasos (summer solstice), on the hill. They rebuilt the altar in 1928. The hill is popular with Lithuanian neo-pagans and hosts the annual celebrations of the summer solstice on 23 June.

Babbitt as its postmaster.[2] With the increased need for agricultural workers which arose in the late 1920s, hundreds of farm workers migrated to the area in the 1930s. Many of those who settled in Randolph were black migrants from Oklahoma. This influx created a community which was predominantly Black.[3]:27 The post office closed in 1983.[3]:30 Today, Randolph is one of the few Black towns which exist in the United States.[3]:32

The original station wasn't built until 1848 though, and by that time the VCRR was acquired by the Central Vermont Railway. By the late-1870s (although signs on the depot suggest 1881), Central Vermont moved the original depot and built a new one, converting the VCRR station into a freight house. When Central Vermont was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1896, the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, a subsidiary of <link wikipedia="Canadian_National_Railway" osm="254959332" type="way">Canadian National Railway</link> bought the railroad and the station out and kept it afloat throughout most of the 20th Century.

RandstadRail is a hybrid system of low-floor tram-train-like carriages used between The Hague and the city of Zoetermeer, and high-floor metro/subway-like carriages between The Hague and Rotterdam. The stations used by both lines have extended platforms with a high and a low part. Moreover, the network includes two bus lines.

The name can be somewhat confusing as for travellers RandstadRail only refers to tram 3 and 4 to Zoetermeer. All other connections as described above are fully integrated in existing metro and bus networks. On the other hand, Hague exploitant HTM considers a regular tram line as RandstadRail, only because it uses the RR-vehicles.[1]
