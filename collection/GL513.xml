The core airfield of the Luftwaffe facility took the form of a typical pre-World War II aerodrome, with no clearly defined "runways", being bounded by a roughly hexagonal-layout perimeter road that still exists today, defining an area approximately 1,700 meters (5,600 feet) across within it of about 234.3 hectares, or 578.9 acres, which today is the site of the annual Fusion music festival.
