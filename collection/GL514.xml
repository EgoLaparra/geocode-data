      <p id="GL514_029_001" num_links="5">According to Scottsville's website, the town "served as Virginia's westernmost center of government and commerce during the 1700s, when rivers were the primary means of travel in the new American wilderness." During the late 18th and the 19th centuries attempts were made to improve navigability along the James, as well as other central Virginian rivers. Part of this was the construction of a canal running roughly parallel with the James west from <link wikipedia="Richmond,_Virginia" osm="2592301390 3864712" type="node relation">Richmond</link>. Scottsville was the largest port town along this route, called the James River and Kanawha Canal. The ultimate goal of this project was to connect the <link wikipedia="Atlantic_Ocean" osm="305640306" type="node">Atlantic</link> with the <link wikipedia="Ohio_River" osm="2182501" type="relation">Ohio River</link> via the <link wikipedia="Kanawha_River" osm="2182498" type="relation">Kanawha River</link>. These aims were not achieved, due to interruption by the American Civil War and the efficiency of the railroads. It did however succeed in making Scottsville a busy, prominent town. In fact, thanks to a wagon road connecting <link wikipedia="Staunton,_Virginia" osm="157572900 206646 3864617" type="node relation relation">Staunton</link> to Scottsville, all of the agricultural wealth of the Shenandoah Valley poured into town en route to Richmond and the sea, thereby making Scottsville the largest grain market in the state. Trade was disrupted when Union soldiers broke the canal works in the area. Then the train came, the tracks being laid directly on the towpath of the old canal, a monument to its demise. Eventually, the train too stopped taking passengers, leaving Scottsville a sleepy country town on a coal line.

 Led by the University's President, the Very W. Coleman Nevils, the Jesuits renovated a building known as the “Annex” on the corner of Mulberry Street and Wyoming Avenue for the high school.[2] The Annex, formerly the Dr. Charles E. Thomson Scranton Private Hospital, was acquired by Bishop William J. Hafey in 1941. Although he had intended for it to be used by the university to expand its facilities, the <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">Second World War</link> in Europe had caused the college’s enrollment to decline precipitously and made such expansions unnecessary.[3] After renovations were completed, the high school was opened in 1944 for young Catholic men.[4] The Annex served as the high school’s home until 1961 when the construction of an expressway necessitated a move to a new location.[5] After making the Old Main Building of the University of Scranton its temporary home for two years, Prep moved to its permanent location, the former Women’s Institute Building of the International Correspondence Schools, at 1000 Wyoming Avenue.[2]

Morris Bodnar, Member of Parliament for Saskatoon—Dundurn, commemorated Seager Wheeler's Maple Grove Farm as a National Historic Site of Canada on August 3, 1996[5]  The site is honoured as the location where hardy wheat and fruit strains were developed which were well suited to the prairie climate and growing season.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some of Chicago's most prominent families attended this church. It is renowned for its interior, completely redone in the Arts and Crafts style after a disastrous fire in 1900. The sanctuary is one of America's best examples of an unaltered Arts and Crafts church interior, fully embodying that movement's principles of simplicity, hand craftsmanship, and unity of design. It also boasts nine imposing Tiffany windows. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and later designated a Chicago Landmark on September 28, 1977.[2]  It was designated a National Historic Landmark in March 2013.[3]
