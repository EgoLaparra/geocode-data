      <p id="GL517_030_001" num_links="3">The area that eventually became the city of Rhinelander was originally called Pelican Rapids by early settlers, named for the stretch of rapids just above the convergence of the Wisconsin and Pelican Rivers. Around 1870, Anderson W. Brown of <link wikipedia="Stevens_Point,_Wisconsin" osm="42835030 251547" type="node relation">Stevens Point</link> and Anson P. Vaughn traveled up the <link wikipedia="Wisconsin_River" osm="4060470" type="relation">Wisconsin River</link>  to cruise timber for Brown's father, E. D. Brown. Upon arriving at the meeting point of the Wisconsin and Pelican Rivers at the site of John Curran's trading post, and seeing the high banks along the rapids and the excellent pine stands, Anderson Brown envisioned a mill town with a lumber mill powered by the waters of the Wisconsin River. Brown's vision did not come to fruition for some years, but after subsequent expeditions with others, including his brother and Rhinelander's first mayor, Webster Brown, the brothers managed to convince their father and uncle to purchase the land from the federal government and build a town. In its charter, the city was named Rhinelander after Frederic W. Rhinelander of New York, who was president of the Milwaukee, Lake Shore and Western Railroad at the time.[7] This was part of a bid by the Brown brothers to induce the railroad to extend a spur to the location to further their lumbering business. Ultimately, after over 10 years of negotiations, the Brown family agreed to convey half their land holdings in the area to the railroad in exchange for a rail line to their future city. In 1882, the railroad line from present-day <link wikipedia="Monico,_Wisconsin" osm="153728601" type="node">Monico</link> to Rhinelander was completed, jump starting the development of Rhinelander as the commercial hub of the region.[8]

The idea was revived in the late 1980s, and a Convention Center Authority was established in 1987 to look into the feasibility of building a convention center along with hotel and parking garage. In 1991, Governor Bruce Sundlun put his full support into the project, making it the centerpiece of a large state-funded  construction project to revitalize Providence's downtown. His plan also included relocating the railroad, and building <link wikipedia="Waterplace_Park" osm="357267619" type="node">Waterplace Park</link> and walkways along the city's rivers. Sundlun argued that a convention center would attract tourists and become an economic engine for the state.[1]

      <p id="GL517_069_002" num_links="2">CSU Rhodes Tower was built between 1968-71. The Brutalist structure was designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Rode, Guenther, and Bonebrake.[3] This style was very prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s in Cleveland and can be seen in the housing projects made in Central and Hough, the Cuyahoga County <link wikipedia="Justice_Center_Complex" osm="189749443" type="way">Justice Center Complex</link>, the <link wikipedia="Cleveland_Museum_of_Art" osm="109114109" type="way">Cleveland Museum of Art</link>, and AT Tower.  It was built at a cost of $21,700,000 including the 2001 renovation. It is a steel structure, clad in white precast concrete panels. There are 2140 separate panels that make up the facing of the massive square tower.[4] When the tower was built, there was controversy over floors shifting; the shifting was caused by ill-fitting bolt fasteners imported from Japan. These bolts had to be replaced with bolts made in the US, not because the Japanese ones were somehow inferior, they simply did not fit the holes. This was due to the fact that the bolts were made in metric in Japan and the floors were built in standard, as such when the buildings crew began to fasten the bolts to the floor joists, the structures unexpectly shifted. This expensive refabrication thus made the building fit for public use.

It was built in 1921 and the theatre was developed as part of a commercial block which incorporated three storefronts and a restaurant occupying the entire second floor.  The block is two stories tall and a broad six bays wide, constructed of brick.  The theatre auditorium extended 136 feet to the rear and constructed of parged concrete.  The former lobby is occupied by a storefront.[2] The auditorium was demolished in 2003.[3] The theater's marquee was removed during renovations in 2012, supposedly because it was deteriorated, when "workers pulled it apart in pieces and junked it," according to a published account.[4]

      <p id="GL517_211_002" num_links="2">The ribat is located on the Ponta da Atalaia, about 1 km north of Arrifana Beach. It was constructed around 1130, probably by the Sufi and Mahdi master of Christian origin, Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi, one of the leading political and religious figures in al-Andalus, the Muslim territory that covered most of <link wikipedia="Iberian_Peninsula" osm="3870917" type="relation">Iberia</link> during the Islamic Golden Age. Between 1130 and 1140 Ibn Qasi wrote his main work, The Removal of the Sandals, which was inspired by both the Old Testament and the Quran. In 1151 he was assassinated in <link wikipedia="Silves,_Portugal" osm="5404107" type="relation">Silves</link> after being accused of betraying Islam by the followers of Abd al-Mu'min and Ibn Almúndir. After this the Ribat of Arrifana was abandoned, with the English crusader and chronicler, Roger of Hoveden, reporting forty years later that it was “recognizable but in ruins”. It is believed that the minaret was used as a watchtower in the fourteenth century. Despite appearing in written records dating back to 1786 and being clearly identifiable as a former inhabited area as late as 1841,[1] the location of the ribat was only identified by archaeologists at the beginning of this millennium. Its architectural features are inspired by the ribats identified in North Africa.[2]

      <p id="GL517_225_002" num_links="2">Ribe is Denmark's oldest surviving city. Ribe began as an open trading market on the north bank of the Ribe River where it runs into the <link wikipedia="North_Sea" osm="9051063" type="relation">North Sea</link>.  Danes, Norwegians, Swedes, Germans, Frisians, English and other cultures occasionally brought exchange goods here from all parts of northwestern Europe. The landscape around Ribe is flat, wind-blown and sandy, without any particular natural harbour, but in former times, boats could enter the river from the sea and reach the town. By the late Medieval period, the natural sedimentation processes of the <link wikipedia="Wadden_Sea" osm="4805502333 5909371" type="node relation">Wadden Sea</link> had closed that option. Ribe Market was sanctioned by either King Angantyr (Ongendus) or King Harald Hildetand as early as 705. In the Viking Era, Ribe was a bustling international trade center, making it an ideal starting point for Christian missionaries from Hamburg to initiate the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia.

It was completed in 1913 on the site of the former Capitol building of the Republic of Texas, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The old Capitol building was operated as a hotel until it was torn down and replaced by a new hotel around 1881. Jesse H. Jones built a new seventeen-story, double-winged hotel in 1913, also  called "The Rice Hotel." This building underwent major expansions: adding a third wing in 1925, adding an eighteenth floor in 1951, and adding a five-story "motor lobby in 1958. In addition, there were several renovations during its life as a hotel. It continued to operate as a hotel before finally shutting down in 1977. After standing vacant for twenty-one years, The Rice, was renovated as apartments and reopened in 1998 as the Post Rice Lofts. It was sold in 2014 and renamed simply The Rice.
