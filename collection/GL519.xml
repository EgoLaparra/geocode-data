Cullinan, an oil baron who founded <link wikipedia="Texaco" osm="207738835" type="way">Texaco</link>,[2] bought the land that would become Shadyside in 1916.[1] Cullinan had purchased 37 acres (15 ha) from the estate of George H. Hermann for an undisclosed amount of money and hired a civil engineer to design the community. The estate wanted to ensure that the land would be controlled by one person. Cullinan said that Hermann himself did not want the new subdivision to adversely affect <link wikipedia="Rice_University" osm="45185995" type="way">Rice Institute</link> and <link wikipedia="Hermann_Park" osm="51816625" type="way">Hermann Park</link>. Cullinan said that his intention was to create a subdivision so that his business acquaintances and friends could live near him. In 1920 Cullinan put the subdivision, with 16 lots, on the market. It sold out within six weeks. The subdivision included a trust agreement stating that there would be no businesses, and that there would be no overhead electric lines or poles placed on any properties. It was scheduled to expire on June 30, 1969. Cullinan donated a piece of land next to Shadyside to the Houston Art League so the league could build a museum; this ensured that Shadyside would remain desirable.[2] Mike Sheridan of the Houston Chronicle said "a story" said that William "Will" Hogg had an interest in buying a house in Shadyside but chose not to do so, and that "some observers say" that Cullinan had intended to sell land to Hogg but the two entered into a dispute over the title, so Hogg decided not to buy land there.[2] Hogg and some associates instead developed <link wikipedia="River_Oaks,_Houston" osm="210881460" type="way">River Oaks</link>.[2]

Immediately students appeared from the neighboring towns and came from all parts of the country to become part of the Karma Dzong Meditation Center in Boulder.  Among these were the members of a commune called the Pigmy Farm, located on the eastern edge of the city.  
In early 1971 a student of Trungpa Rinpoche, Jonathan Eric, inherited $100,000 from an uncle.  He gave the money to Trungpa and Karma Dzong, and it was used to purchase what became the Rocky Mountain Dharma Center (now called Shambhala Mountain Center), as well as Tail of the Tiger in Barnet, Vermont (now called Karme Chöling).  The Pigmies and others were the original inhabitants.

It is an area with fertile soils hence there is high farming activity. According to the 1982 Population Census, the village had a population of 4,617. People have been living in this area before European settlers came in. The village was established in 1895 when gold was discovered in the area.  It was originally known as Abercorn but was changed to avoid confusion with Abercorn (now <link wikipedia="Mbala,_Zambia" osm="369007774" type="node">Mbala</link>) in <link wikipedia="Zambia" osm="432425123 195271" type="node relation">Zambia</link>. The name Shamva is derived from Tsamvi a tree common in that region. Early settlers could not pronounce Tsamvi hence changed it to Shamva. In the First Chimurenga many of the settlers died in an attack on the village. The railway arrived in the town in 1913.It is also where many African people died in fight for the struggle of independence.
A vast majority of the population survives through gold panning. The area is rich in alluvial gold and most of it is found along the Mazowe basin. Gold panning is the greatest threat to the environment in the area. Shamva residents get their water supply from Mazowe river which runs about 5 km from Wadzanai Township.

These individuals were uncovered amongst a Mousterian layer accompanied by various stone tools and animal remains. The remains of ten Neanderthals, dating from around 65,000-35,000 years ago, have been found within the cave.[2][1] The cave also contains two later "proto-Neolithic" cemeteries, one of which dates back about 10,600 years and contains 35 individuals.[3]

Shanxi's terrain is characterised by a plateau bounded partly by mountain ranges. Shanxi's culture is largely dominated by the ethnic Han majority, who make up over 99% of its population. Jin Chinese is considered by some linguists to be a distinct language from Mandarin, and its geographical range covers most of Shanxi. Both Jin and Mandarin are spoken in Shanxi.

The ridge also is the site of a transmitting antenna farm that serves most of Knoxville's broadcasters.[1][2]  The highest ground point on the ridge is an abandoned fire tower located at 1,391 feet (424 m) above mean sea level.  The ridge itself averages 200 to 300 feet (40 to 60 m) above the surrounding valley floor,[1] allowing panoramic views of the Great Smoky Mountains and adjacent ranges to the east and the Cumberland Plateau to the west.
