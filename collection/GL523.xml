The red granite was acquired from the receiver of a bankrupt packing plant which had begun, but did not complete, a new stone building.  It is used for the trim, especially in the voussoirs of alternating colors.  The building also features a tall corner bell tower.

Protected by the French law on sites naturels classés and currently at the heart of a grand site national operation, it draws its fame severally as a rare geological phenomenon of the region, as a prehistoric site of the eponymous Solutrean paleolithic culture, and for the natural environment which its summit provides, the pelouse calciole grassland of Mâcon, with its distinctive flora and fauna. Occupied by man for at least 55,000 years, it is also the cradle of the Pouilly-Fuissé wine appellation. It has attracted media coverage since the 1980s when French President François Mitterrand started to make ritual ascents of the peak once per year.

Rockbridge County was formed during an act of assembly intended to reduce the amount of travel to the nearest courthouse, and to ensure trials were held fairly, and among friends rather than strangers. The first court session in Rockbridge County was held at the home of Samuel Wallace on April 7, 1778.  Slaves were far fewer in Rockbridge County than in many parts of Virginia, and, thus, the anti-slavery movement was stronger in Rockbridge than in many other counties of Virginia.  For instance, several faculty members at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) vigorously opposed slavery. However, many of the wealthiest residents of Rockbridge County owned slaves and passed down those slaves to their widows and children.[4]

Its harbor, long regarded as one of the finest east of <link wikipedia="Portland,_Maine" osm="158867610 132500" type="node relation">Portland</link>, was frequently used in the 19th century as a safe harbor during bad weather.  It was less than ideally suited to this task, because its large east-facing opening would still subject ships at anchor to storms with winds from the northeast.  Major storms in the 1850s highlighted the need for improved harbor protection, but federal appropriation for a project was not approved until 1880.  Between 1880 and 1900 the United States Army Corps of Engineers, under a series of Congressional appropriations, built the breakwater, which is more than 4,000 feet (1,200 m) long.[4]

Part of the beach is sheltered by cliffs.[2]  Rodeo Beach is known for its dark, pebbly sand, its uses for surfing and sunbathing, and its locale as a place for viewing, but not collecting, semi-precious stones.[3] This beach is unique among California beaches in that it is largely made up of coarse, pebbly chert grains, both red and green in color. Its mineral composition sets it apart from every other beach in the state[4][5] Surfing is possible throughout the year and at all tidal stages, but is best in summer[3] — although there is a risk of shark attacks. Due to the North bar offshore of this beach it results in big waves in the winter months with the big swells that come in.[6] Strong currents make swimming dangerous.

Her husband, a poverty-stricken Ukrainian peasant, refused to adopt her son and expelled him when Malinovsky was only 13 years old. The homeless boy survived by working as a farmhand, and eventually received shelter from his aunt's family in Odessa, where he worked as an errand boy in a general store. 
After the start of World War I in July 1914, Malinovsky, who was only 15 years old at the time (too young for military service), hid on the military train heading for the German front, but was discovered. He nevertheless convinced the commanding officers to enlist him as a volunteer, and served in a machine-gun detachment in the frontline trenches. In October 1915, as a reward for repelling a German attack, he received his first military award, the Cross of St. George of the 4th class, and was promoted to the rank of corporal. Soon afterwards, he was badly wounded and spent several months in the hospital.

At the road junction to Roedtan stands a monument to the battle of Moordrift in 1854 when 33 white people (descendants mainly of Dutch settlers from the 17th and 18th centuries who had moved north from the Cape Colony to escape what they saw as oppressive rule by the British colonial government - such as having to give up their slaves (and, worse, having to co-exist with them on equal terms) in line with the legislated emancipation of all slaves in the British Empire in 1833) were killed in a skirmish with the local tribe headed by Makapane. The cave, Makapansgat, is now known to record early hominid occupation (1,500,000 years ago) and is a national monument. The Springbok Flats is a reminder that great herds of Springbok once populated the plain, which was also frequented by lions and other wild animals.
