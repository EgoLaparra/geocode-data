Themed to Disney's 1935 short film The Band Concert, Mickey Mouse conducts from high atop the attraction, synchronized with the music.[1] Although The Band Concert was not part of the Silly Symphonies film series, the name was applied to the attraction as a result of its symphony storyline.[2] Closely following the plot of The Band Concert the main column of the ride rises, revealing a tornado which spins the riders to the tune of the William Tell Overture and William Tell's "Storm". Once the tornado safely passes, the music comes to an end and the ride slows and lowers riders to the ground. It is speculated that the new voice of the Silly Symphony Swings is that of the fictitious Mr. Tinkershmidt, the supposed new owner of Paradise Pier. Tinkershmidt[citation needed] and the Silly Symphony Swings update was part of the multi-year, $1.1 billion (US) expansion plan for Disney's California Adventure Park.[3] Previews of the attraction were offered at California Adventure's <link wikipedia="Walt_Disney_Imagineering_Blue_Sky_Cellar" osm="161495898" type="way">Walt Disney Imagineering Blue Sky Cellar</link>.

Although the lake is a reservoir, which prevents recreational activities to keep the drinking water clean, the water from the diversions are not and can pump in contaminated water. Monponsett Pond in particular has reoccurring toxic algae growths which get transferred into the lake. It is supposed to be the main source of the Jones River by contributing about twenty percent of the river's flow, but the Forge Pond Dam near its base lets out minimal, some years no, water to the river. This also prevents migratory aquatic animals from reaching the lake. Brockton prefers to keep the dam to have more accessible water. Access to the pond is through Silver Lake Sanctuary, a 92-acre (370,000 m2) property where one can walk, hike and fish, which is located at the end of Barses Lane, off Route 27 in Kingston.

Describing the peak as "calico-colored", the peak, the mountain range to which it belonged, and the town that followed were all called Calico.[5] The four prospectors discovered silver in the mountain and opened the Silver King Mine, which was California's largest silver producer in the mid-1880s.[5] A <link wikipedia="Post_office" osm="363499122 4979832588 495969245" type="node node way">post office</link> was established in early 1882, and the Calico Print, a weekly newspaper, started publishing. The town soon supported three hotels, five general stores, a meat market, bars, brothels, and three restaurants and boarding houses.

There was also a Wells Fargo office and a telephone and telegraph service.[5] At its height of silver production during 1883 and 1885,[6] Calico had over 500 mines and a population of 1,200 people.[5] Local badmen were buried in the Boot Hill cemetery.[7][8]

Silver Reef was established after John Kemple, a prospector from Nevada, discovered a vein of silver in a sandstone formation in 1866. At first, geologists were uncertain about Kemple's find because silver is not usually found in sandstone. In 1875, two bankers from <link wikipedia="Salt_Lake_City" osm="150935219 198770" type="node relation">Salt Lake City</link> sent William Barbee to the site to stake mining claims. He staked 21 claims,[2] and an influx of miners came to work Barbee's claims and to stake their own. To accommodate the miners, Barbee established a town called Bonanza City. Property values there were high, so several miners settled on a ridge to the north of it and named their settlement "Rockpile".[3]  The town was renamed Silver Reef after silver mines in nearby <link wikipedia="Pioche,_Nevada" osm="150970546" type="node">Pioche</link> closed and businessmen arrived.

Portions of the town sit on a former Mexican land grant Rancho Lomas de Santiago.  Silverado is located at the boundaries of <link wikipedia="Cleveland_National_Forest" osm="2788396" type="relation">Cleveland National Forest</link>. The area was mined for silver during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Remnants of mining operations such as the Blue Light Mine are still scattered in the area. Timber was harvested for use by the railroad. Coal was mined  at the time in Carbondale.  Ancient sea life fossils can be found within the sandstone cliffs in the area. During Spanish rule, the canyon was visited by Spanish explorers and was known by the name Cañada de la Madera (Timber Canyon). The town in Spain by that name bears a remarkable resemblance to Silverado.[2] (The name Silverado is a type of Spanglish indicating a place where silver is found; a parallel formation to <link wikipedia="El_Dorado" osm="6486170" type="relation">El Dorado</link>.) The area enjoyed a renaissance in popularity in the 1940s as a hot springs vacation retreat, during which time hotels and restaurants prospered. Many weekend cabins were also built at that time. Home to a number of artists and craftsmen, the town now consists of about 2000 residents, a general store, a cafe, a public library, a church, two fire stations, a community center, and a post office. It hosts summer concerts, an annual Country Fair,[3] and an Easter breakfast. A local landmark near Silverado is Cook's Corner, popular with motorcyclists.

Edward Simeon's brother John Simeon was a former Member of Parliament for Reading who had lost his seat in the 1802 elections to the parliament of the newly created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, since which time the family had been engaged in ostentatious spending locally in an effort to gain support among the town's voters. Although street lighting had been installed in Reading in 1797, the system used was one of lamps attached to the sides of buildings and as a consequence open spaces remained unlit. In 1804 Simeon persuaded the Mayor of Reading that it would be of benefit to erect a structure in Market Place, which would serve both to carry lamps to light the area and to improve the flow of traffic in the area, and volunteered to pay for such a structure himself.

It is located at 757 West Hastings Street between Granville and Howe streets. The centre comprises four buildings that were restored and connected by a new atrium space designed by Henriquez Partners Architects and Toby Russell Buckwell Architects in 1986.[1]  The cost for this work was 38 million. The main post office was housed here from 1910 until the new one opened in 1958. The Post Office Building is in an Edwardian Baroque style, combining English and French influences. It features an atrium clock consisting of four 12-foot-diameter (3.7 m) clocks built in 1909 and is the largest clock movement in Western Canada; the minute hands alone weigh 92 kilograms (202 pounds) each. In addition to the mall, the building has a seven floor office tower occupied by the federal government.[2] The buildings that comprise the centre are the Post Office (1910 - David Ewart), the handsome and architecturally esteemed[3] Winch Building (1911 - Thomas Hooper), the Customs Examining Warehouse (1913 - David Ewart), and the Federal Building (1937 - Thomas W. Fuller). The mall is home to elite boutiques.[4] The complex was renovated in 1986 and announced on November 13, 1983 that it was to be renamed after James Sinclair, member of Parliament for Vancouver North and later Coast—Capilano as well as Minister of Fisheries. Sinclair is the maternal grandfather of 23rd Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.[5][6][7]
