Harris assisted British Chief of the Air Staff Marshal of the Royal Air Force <link wikipedia="Charles_Portal,_1st_Viscount_Portal_of_Hungerford" osm="2622441755" type="node">Charles Portal</link> in carrying out the <link wikipedia="United_Kingdom" osm="838090640 62149" type="node relation">United Kingdom</link>'s most devastating attacks against the German infrastructure and population, including the Bombing of Dresden.

The original fortress dates to the 11th century, and is still in use today by the Yemeni military.[1]  The fort is located on Sira Island, a rocky and tall volcanic outcropping which dominates the old harbor of Aden.  Much of the fort's history is unknown, especially since there have been few archaeological studies done of the area.  One theory is that construction was initiated around the year 1173 by a Turkish ruler of Aden named Prince Othman Al-Zangabili Al-Takriti.[2]  The fortress was proven during subsequent attacks against Aden by the Portuguese and especially the Turks in 1517.  Although the ancient harbor began to silt up and the primary commercial center eventually moved to the other side of the Aden Peninsula, the British continued to develop and garrison the fortress after their arrival in 1839.[2]

      <p id="GL527_280_002" num_links="8">After the Crimean War, the Ottoman authorities concluded that a railway connecting Europe with Istanbul was necessary. The first contract was signed with Labro, a British member of parliament, in January 1857. The contract was cancelled three months later because Labro was unable to provide the investment capital required. Similar second and third contracts signed with British and Belgian entrepreneurs in 1860 and 1868 ended with the same result. On 17 April 1869 the concession for the "Rumeli Railroad" was awarded to Baron Maurice de Hirsch (Moritz Freiherr Hirsch auf Gereuth), a <link wikipedia="Bavaria" osm="473848012 2145268" type="node relation">Bavaria</link>-born banker from <link wikipedia="Belgium" osm="1684793666 52411" type="node relation">Belgium</link>.

The construction of the first 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Istanbul to Halkalı began on 4 June 1870 and was completed on 4 January 1871. An extension of the line to Sirkeci was demanded as the starting point since Yeşilköy was too far away from Eminönü, the main business district of that epoch. The first proposed option for the line was a route from Beyazit down to the shore of the <link wikipedia="Golden_Horn" osm="2791545" type="relation">Golden Horn</link>. The Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz decided and permitted the route to run on the shoreline of the <link wikipedia="Sea_of_Marmara" osm="5511568" type="relation">Sea of Marmara</link> bordering the walls of Topkapı Palace’s lower garden.

Sisler was instrumental in helping new immigrant families adjust.  He faced a great challenge in the fact that a majority of the students did not speak English; there were twenty-two countries of origin and eighteen language groups in his student body.  In addition, many of his students came from areas where they were deprived of their right to an education.  In his book Peaceful Invasion, W.J. Sisler says "Once they understood the value of education that was freely offered to them they took full advantage of all that we could give them".  He adapted the education system for his immigrant students, and the provincial government of Manitoba soon officially adopted his method of teaching.[1]  Sisler High School today has a large ESL (English as a Second Language) program.

When Edward Fitzgerald Beale built Beale's Wagon Road over this pass, he named it John Howells Pass for one of the men in his expedition in October, 1857.

Sitgreaves' expedition never crossed the Black Mountains by this pass, but did farther north, at Secret Pass or at Union Pass.

In 1839 Arvid Adolf Etholén, himself a Swedish-speaking Finn, was appointed the eighth governor of the colony by which time there were approximately 150 Lutherans working in New Archangel. At the urging of Etholén and Ferdinand von Wrangel, a previous manager of the Russian-American Company, the Russian government agreed to establish a Lutheran parish there which would be part of the Lutheran diocese of St. Petersburg.  Etholén arrived in Sitka in 1840 with his young wife Margaretha who was a devout Lutheran and Uno Cygnaeus who was to be the first pastor. While the new church was being built, the congregation worshiped in one of the rooms of the governor's residence, <link wikipedia="Castle_Hill_(Sitka,_Alaska)" osm="238267507 243594065" type="way way">Baranof Castle</link>.[4][5]

However, the outbreak of <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link> stopped the shipment. The empty transmitter buildings in Sitkunai survived the war with almost no damage and were used as military compound by the German army in 1941-1944, and later as a primary school. Because the Soviet Lithuania was badly covered by radio signals, the Soviet authorities decided to continue the building work at Sitkunai and turn the site into a main shortwave and medium wave transmitting centre. During 1951 and 1952 two 50 kW shortwave transmitters, dismantled from an East German utility site as war reparations were installed in Sitkūnai. Several curtain antennas were erected and one 150 kW mediumwave transmitter was installed (665 kHz).
