This included constructing the current station building at Meade and Washington and selling the old downtown station, which had opened in 1921. When Amtrak took over intercity rail service in 1971, it used this station instead of the larger Union Station.[3][4][5] The South Shore Line moved its terminus to a <link wikipedia="South_Bend_Airport_station" osm="1268318822" type="node">new terminal</link> at the <link wikipedia="South_Bend_International_Airport" osm="224696857" type="way">South Bend International Airport</link> in November 1992, although the track that used to terminate here was retained.[6]

      <p id="GL535_070_002" num_links="2">The oldest part of the hamlet is along the main street, Bridge Street. The heart of the community is the four corners formed by the intersection of Bridge Street with South Street (Albany County Route 101) and Willowbrook Avenue. In the 18th century, this place was called Janes Corners for resident Elishama Janes, and Kimmey's Corners in 1864 for Philip Kimmey.[1]   The South Bethlehem Plank Road was incorporated in 1851 with a charter lasting 30 years to build and operate a plank road from Bethlehem Center to South Bethlehem. The road began in Bethlehem Center at an intersection with the Albany and Bethlehem Turnpike, and traveled south to Becker's Corners, this section is today <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_9W" osm="182372 2298947 2298948" type="relation relation relation">US Route 9W</link>; and then southwest from that hamlet to South Bethlehem, today New York State Route 396. The charter was renewed in 1881 and the use of planks was discontinued in favor of gravel and stone.[2] The South Bethlehem <link wikipedia="Post_office" osm="363499122 4979832588 495969245" type="node node way">post office</link> was established in 1874.[3]

</p>
      <p id="GL535_096_002" num_links="4">In the 1960s, the Port Authority began phasing out streetcar lines and replacing them with buses. The creation of a rail rapid transit system was also discussed, and one of the target routes was a corridor bordering Route 51 through the <link wikipedia="Brookline_(Pittsburgh)" osm="6897587" type="relation">Brookline</link> and <link wikipedia="Overbrook_(Pittsburgh)" osm="6897586" type="relation">Overbrook</link> neighborhoods. While light rail would be developed during the following decade, the Port Authority decided to use the corridor to allows buses to avoid the crowded, narrow, and stop light-filled Route 51. In 1977, a two-lane route was constructed in a valley close to the road. Unlike later American busways, including the city's <link wikipedia="Martin_Luther_King_Jr._East_Busway" osm="4051383" type="relation">Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway</link> (opened in 1983) and <link wikipedia="West_Busway" osm="4051402" type="relation">West Busway</link> (opened in 2000), the route was not designed as a route in itself and does not feature the amenities associated with modern BRTs, such as branded buses, special stations, or other rail-like features. Instead, standard bus shelters are included and no routes terminate at the end of the busway. The main goal of the road is to allow for suburban buses to operate more quickly and to encourage the use of public transportation by allowing riders to avoid a highly congested highway.  Following the naming convention of each busway being designated by a color, bus routes that use the South Busway begin with a "Y" for yellow.

The historic industries of the village were agriculture, stocking, spinning and mining. Normanton means 'the farm of the north men' or 'Northwegans'. It was a purely agricultural settlement but added tanning as a secondary industry during medieval times, using the bark of the oak and birch, both plentiful in the area. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the main industries were framework knitting and mining. The knitters, or shiners as they were known from the state of their trouser seats after a 14-hour day sitting at their machines, tended to live in certain areas, around the Dog Pool, along Water Lane and particularly up the narrow alleys around the Old Market place.

West of the Omo is the most sparsely populated part of Ethiopia, inhabited by nomadic and semi-nomadic ethnic groups. A 1996 report described the infrastructure of the Zone as "weak and for the most part non-existent; this is a disadvantage inherited from historical neglect of a typical marginal region." It also observed that the Debub Omo Zone "one of Ethiopian's socially most diverse zones. It contains a minimum of 12 different ethnic groups, and possibly as many as 21. Social diversity therefore compounds the existing problems of isolation, acute shortage of basic infrastructure as well as scarcity of professional and technical man-power."[1]
