Towards the end of the Industrial Revolution, the area saw rapid growth in population and urban development. This expansion was in part due to an influx of working class laborers and immigrants looking for factory jobs and dock work, as well as the first wave of mass immigration of refugees and impoverished immigrants from <link wikipedia="Ireland" osm="7681896" type="relation">Ireland</link> in the wake of the Great Irish Hunger.

He was impressed by the park and its design within an urban environment. Despite South Salt Lake being rural at the time, he decided to name the area Central Park. In 1925 the <link wikipedia="The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" osm="4593317367 81369707 481406554" type="node way way">LDS</link> Central Park Ward was created and named after the development.   In 1936, an attempted annexation by Salt Lake City failed due to concerns over funding and implementation of a sewer system. On August 14, 1936 a resolution creating the Town of Central Park was approved by the Board of County Commissioners - however, this did last long, as voters then decided to disincorporate the town in 1937. In a close vote, voters then approved incorporation of South Salt Lake. On September 29, 1938, still in need of a sewer system, South Salt Lake voted to incorporate as the Town of South Salt Lake, with Robert R. Fitts as the first town president. The town was also lacking many other basic amenities at the time that would be easier to implement with incorporation, such as a post office and fire department. In 1939, the Works Progress Administration finally began construction of a sewer system, with a cost of $462,000. The original boundary of South Salt Lake was from 500 East to 300 West and 2100 South to Mill Creek on the south. On August 1, 1950 the population had increased enough for South Salt Lake to be designated as a third class city. This changed the form of government to a mayor and city council. The town president of the time, Marlow Callahan, became the first mayor of the City of South Salt Lake.[3] In the 1990s, South Salt Lake annexed portions of an unincorporated portion of Salt Lake County to the south, and nearly doubled in land area and population.

This province is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, natural gas and coal. The province is very diverse, as it is inhabited by many different ethnic groups. The Malays is the dominant ethnic group in the province. Most of them spoke the Palembang Malay, which is mutually unintelligible to both Indonesian and Standard Malay. Other ethnic groups also inhabits the province, such as the Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau and Chinese. Most of them are concentrated around urban areas, as they are mostly immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.

      <p id="GL536_112_002" num_links="10">The province was once the seat of many great kingdoms and empires. From the 7th century to the late 14th century, the province was the seat of the Buddhist Srivijaya Empire, which influenced much of Southeast Asia.[4] Srivijaya was an important centre for the expansion of Buddhism from the 8th to the 12th century. Srivijaya was the first unified kingdom to dominate much of Indonesian archipelago.[5] Owing to its geographical position, the capital of Srivijaya, <link wikipedia="Palembang" osm="2081450443" type="node">Palembang</link>, becomes one of the most thriving port in the region. The city was frequented by many traders from the <link wikipedia="Middle_East" osm="414980155 415145069" type="node node">Middle-East</link>, the <link wikipedia="Indian_subcontinent" osm="5839621119" type="node">Indian Subcountinent</link> and <link wikipedia="China" osm="424313582 270056" type="node relation">China</link>. At the height of its power, the territory of the Srivijaya Empire reached modern-day <link wikipedia="Thailand" osm="437146363 903822 2067731" type="node relation relation">Thailand</link>, <link wikipedia="Cambodia" osm="432424952 49898" type="node relation">Cambodia</link> and <link wikipedia="Malaysia" osm="249399394 2108121" type="node relation">Malaysia</link>. After Srivijaya collapsed in the 14th century, small kingdoms began to establish itself in the province. Beginning in the 16th century, Islam began to spread in the region, effectively replacing Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion in the region. In the 17th century, the Islamic Palembang Sultanate was established with Palembang as its capital. At that time, however, Europeans began arriving in the region, first the Portuguese and then the Dutch. The Dutch became the dominant power in the region. Through the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the Dutch exerted influence on the Palembang Sultanate. In 1811, during the Napoleonic Wars, the last Sultan of Palembang, Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II attacked the Dutch in Palembang, but he refused to cooperate with the British, so Thomas Stamford Raffles sent troops to attack Palembang and Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II was forced to flee the royal palace, then Raffles appointed the Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin II, brother of Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II as king. In 1813 Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II again took over the kingdom, but one month later he was brought down again by Raffles and reappointed Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin II, causing a split in the Sultanate of Palembang.[6] After the Dutch returned to the region, the Dutch attacked and annexed the sultanate to the Dutch East Indies, and exiled the sultan and his family to <link wikipedia="Ternate" osm="545807270" type="node">Ternate</link>. The Dutch controlled the region for the next century, but during <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>, the Japanese attacked Palembang and expelled the Dutch. The Japanese occupied the region until August 1945, when they surrendered to the Allied forces. The Dutch attempted to return to the region, but this was opposed by the newly-declared <link wikipedia="Indonesia" osm="6677037562 304751" type="node relation">Republic Of Indonesia</link>, resulting in a war of independence. In the end, the Dutch recognize the Indonesian sovereignty and withdrew from the region in 1950. The province of South Sumatra was formed in 12 September 1950.

The southern ice stream used to be connected to a northern ice stream coming down south from the Tahoma Glacier encompassing a jagged 7,690 feet (2,344 m) high sub-peak of Rainier called Glacier Island, but retreat has separated the glaciers at an elevation below 8,000 ft (2,400 m).[2] Meltwater from the glacier drains into the Nisqually River.[1]

By the late 12th century the royal castle had been largely converted to stone, playing an important part in the wine trade conducted through the Southampton docks.

It is a tapering, multi-tiered pylon which culminates in a series of diminishing layers before terminating in a sarcophagus (or cenotaph, "empty tomb") which features a recumbent figure of a soldier. In front is an altar-like Stone of Remembrance. The cenotaph contains multiple sculptural details including a prominent cross, the town's coat of arms, and two lions. The names of the dead are inscribed on three sides. Although similar in outline, Lutyens' later cenotaphs were much more austere and featured almost no sculpture. The design uses abstract, ecumenical features and lifts the recumbent soldier high above eye level, anonymising him.

Its cemetery buildings were designed by architect H. J. Paull and its layout attributed to the city surveyor, James Gascoigne Lynde. The cemetery opened on 9 October 1879 and had mortuary chapels for Anglicans, Nonconformists, and <link wikipedia="Catholic_Church" osm="618656792" type="way">Roman Catholics</link> linked by an elliptical drive and a Jewish chapel at the west corner of the site. The original cemetery is registered by English Heritage in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens for its historic interest and the mortuary chapels and other structures are listed buildings. The site was expanded by the purchase of 90 acres (36 ha) on the opposite side of Nell Lane in 1926, the first section of which opened in 1943. Some of the 1926 purchase has been developed for housing and some is occupied by allotments.[3]</p>

The castle had a square central keep, two rectangular gun platforms to the east and west, and two angled bastions to the front and rear, and was an early English example of the trace italienne-style of fortification popular on the Continent. The Cowdray engraving of the Battle of the Solent in 1545 depicted Henry VIII visiting the castle. Despite several serious fires, it remained in service and saw brief action at the start of the English Civil War in 1642 when it was stormed by Parliamentary forces.
