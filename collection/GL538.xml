There is a sixth form.  The school has dual specialist status in business and enterprise, and in visual, creative and performing arts. Spires is independently governed, but funded by the sponsors and the Department for Children, Schools and Families. As a non-selective school the school does not insist on prospective pupils passing the eleven-plus examination for entry, and it is free to attend. The Academy is subject, like other schools, to regular inspections, but is managed by an ‘Academy Trust’ rather than a local education authority. According to Ofsted inspectors, boys do worse at maths at the school, and generally the school needs to improve (academically).

When Lotsewa Rinchen Zangpo (Translator) came to that place he said that an exemplary religious community would arise there and so the monastery was called spituk (exemplary). During the time of Dharma raja Gragspa Bum-Ide the monastery was restored by Lama Lhawang Lodos and the stainless order of Tsonkhapa was introduced and it has remained intact as such till present.

The developers originally wanted to call the community Spring Lake and used that as the working name through the development process. They were forced to use a different name due to the name Spring Lake already being in use locally and chose Spring Hill.[6] The plans for the community are identical to the community of <link wikipedia="Deltona,_Florida" osm="154104573 117940" type="node relation">Deltona</link>. The Mackle Brothers sold many of the properties and land in the area through intense advertising.[7] It has since become a sprawling semi-city in its own right, though it is an unincorporated area. The main entrance to the original development is marked by the Spring Hill waterfall on Spring Hill Drive and <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_19" osm="1271756" type="relation">U.S. Route 19</link> (Commercial Way).

Local street names include Rhine, Woessner, Haslage, Zoller and Goehring. In 1959 ACTION-Housing opened Spring Hill Gardens, a moderate rent, racially integrated, 209-unit apartment project at Buente and Rhine Streets.

Ballance began in <link wikipedia="San_Antonio" osm="27090054 253556" type="node relation">San Antonio, Texas</link>, and soon after moved to Devine, Texas, where the company gained momentum and popularity. In 1974, Ballance sold the company to the Reese family, who had a well-established production shop in <link wikipedia="Illinois" osm="553784069 122586" type="node relation">Illinois</link> and experience base. The company then expanded its market into pistols, including the M1911.  After further success, the company began to branch into other types of firearms. The company, now run by Dennis Reese (formally along with his brother Tom Reese), manufactures and imports dozens of different firearms in many styles and models.  A motto used by the company, "The First Name in American Firearms" (alternatively "The Oldest Name in American Firearms"), is an homage to the first U.S. national armory and namesake, the original Springfield Armory.[4][non-primary source needed] There is no other connection between the company and defunct federal armory other than its name.
