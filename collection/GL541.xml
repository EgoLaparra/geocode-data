John McAllister was hired as the founding principal of the school, along with only 12 original teachers and 3 secretaries. The school opened with 143 grade 9 students in a temporary location in Streetsville during its formation. The school shared this facility with John Cabot Catholic Secondary School and St. Edmund Campion Secondary School. In September 2004, the school moved to its new permanent facility at Mavis Road and Courtneypark Drive West. The state of the art institution is part of a shared facility agreement with the City of Mississauga. The campus includes the second largest library in the City of Mississauga and a track and field complex that boasts a $1,000,000 artificial field and an 8 lane all weather track. St. Marcellinus Secondary School is well known for academic excellence and athletic expertise with a wide variety of clubs and arts activities. The school motto is “Let Every Spirit Soar.” In 2013, the St.Marcellinus Improv Team won first place in the Canadian Improv Games, the first team from Mississauga ever to win the National title.

      <p id="GL541_195_002" num_links="2">Delaware's first Masses were celebrated by travelling priests in the homes of the city's few Catholics,[2] most of whom were Irish or German immigrants.[3]  The members built the first St. Mary's Church in 1850, but six years passed before Archbishop Purcell appointed the first priest to serve as the pastor.  This man, Casper Wiese, quickly founded a <link wikipedia="Catholic_school" osm="4636800063" type="node">parish school</link> and bought a piece of land for use as a parish cemetery.  A series of short-tenured pastorates followed Wiese's four-year time; the longest, that of Henry Fehlings, ended during the process of regional reorganization following the creation of the Diocese of Columbus.  Fehlings' pastorate saw the parish expand outward from its small frame building: a brick addition to the church was constructed in 1865, a nearby store was purchased and converted into premises for the parish school, and a nearby house was purchased and converted into a rectory.  By 1880, the parish had reached a membership of approximately seven hundred.[2]  In 1886, the present house of worship was constructed on <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_36" osm="443217 2308748 2308749" type="relation relation relation">William Street</link> near downtown.[1]

The design is attributed to New York architect Frank Wills, a prominent 19th century proponent of the Gothic Revival. Wills' belief in the English Country church as the ideal model for American Episcopal congregations can be clearly seen in the design of St. Mary's. Two other churches by Wills are known in the region, Christ Church in <link wikipedia="Napoleonville,_Louisiana" osm="132162" type="relation">Napoleonville, Louisiana</link> and the Chapel of the Cross near Madison, Mississippi. In 1858 the church was consecrated by Bishop (later Confederate General) Leonidas Polk, the "Fighting Bishop" of Civil War fame. The church was built on the Old East Tunica Road on 5 acres donated by Sarah Mulford, The title description is written "per aversionem" so that the boundaries cannot be identified exactly. In 1928 State Highway 66 was built about 1/2 mile west of the church and the old road was abandoned, leaving the church with no vehicular access, except by private farm roads. The church was deconsecrated in 1947, and today stands empty, gradually being overtaken by the surrounding forest, which has completely overgrown the graveyard north of the church and the old roadway.

These were later replaced on the same site by buildings in 1876-78 of Victorian/Second Empire style with mansard roofs although the central chapel of Godefroy endured. In the 1970s, the Victorian buildings were unfortunately also razed leaving St. Mary's Park with a historic bandstand to now surround the old Chapel and Mother Seton House. To the east in the 1980s was constructed a four-lane landscaped parkway with median strip of the Martin Luther King, Jr.  Boulevard, edged by short brick retaining walls which curved around the west side of downtown Baltimore like an inner "beltway".

For many years, the improvement of the parish's facilities was hindered by its size; the fewness of its members meant that money was frequently scarce.[4]  Nevertheless, parishioners took significant steps in late 1906; their first temporary <link wikipedia="Church_(building)" osm="253234529 6377990711 681499085" type="node node way">church</link> was completed in September, and in this year they purchased a tract of land on the eastern side of the village.

It is one of the city's oldest churches. Its construction began in 1039 and it was inaugurated on 1 May 1048 by Bernold, Bishop of Utrecht (although the lost west towers were probably only finished about a century after the inauguration).  The church was the eastern end of Utrecht's "Kerkenkruis", of which the <link wikipedia="St._Martin's_Cathedral,_Utrecht" osm="33492308" type="way">Domkerk</link> the centre is.  Characteristic of the Romanesque style in which it is built are the church's large nave pillars, each hewn from one piece of red sandstone, and the crypt under the choir.  The building is now used by the Walloon Church.
