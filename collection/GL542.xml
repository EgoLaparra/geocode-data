The first Episcopal service in Circleville was held on May 26, 1817, by the Rev. Philander Chase, who in 1819 became the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Ohio. The stone church building was built in 1866 in a mixed Gothic and Tudor Revival style and was consecrated in 1868.[2]  Besides its actual name, the church has been known as the "Little Church on the Mound,"[2] because it sits on the base of what was formerly one of Circleville's numerous Native American mounds that was historically known as "Mount Gilboa."[3]

An avid collector and admirer of relics, he obtained the remains of St. Stephen in Rome and donated them to the church. The St. Stephen Church served as a parish church for the upper part of New Town (in the lower part of New Town this function is fulfilled by the Church of St Henry and St Kunnigunde). At first the church was managed by the order of Knights of the Cross with the Red Star (Czech: Křižovníci), just when Charles IV. received most of the land for the founding of New Town.[1] The church was built in the years 1351 – 1401, when the main builder master George is mentioned. Completion of the western tower is dated to the year 1401, when the whole church must have already been built. The church also had a large lot, filling most of the space between the present-day streets Štěpánská, Ječná, Na Rybníčku and Žitná. There was a parish garden and a large <link wikipedia="Cemetery" osm="24217949" type="way">cemetery</link>. During the plague epidemic in 1502, more than fifteen thousand people were buried there.[2] Several buildings were there: a rectory (in the southwest corner), a school, a wooden belfry (which was rebuilt in stone in the early 17th century), the Chapel of All Saints, Jerusalem chapel,[3] as well as the rotunda of St. Login.
In 1686, the Cornel Chapel was built to the south wall of the nave and then the Branber Chapel to the north wall of the sacristy, which was opened in 1739. In 1866 a Neo-Gothic hall was built in the north part of the nave. A known restorer of that time, <link wikipedia="Josef_Mocker" osm="5620257577" type="node">Josef Mocker</link> redesigned, restored the church in a puristic style in 1874 – 1879. He was responsible for restoring many Bohemian castles and ancient buildings in Prague. His work in a puristic Gothic Revival style aroused much controversy, but also contributed to many important landmarks of Prague. Here Josef Mocker designed a new tracery in the presbytery, a new window in the nave, and also a frontage in the aisle. 
Nowadays, the church is managed by <link wikipedia="Catholic_Church" osm="618656792" type="way">Roman Catholic</link> parish of St. Stephen and is owned by the Archdiocese of Prague.

</p>
      <p id="GL542_149_002" num_links="2">St. Thomas High School was established in 1900 as St. Thomas College and housed that year at Franklin Avenue and Caroline Street.  The founders were the Rev.

In 1903, permanency was assured when Father Roche bought a block of land at Austin and Hadley and constructed Houston's first College Preparatory School for boys.  Thanks to the foresight of a native Texan, The Rev. T.P.

The nearby St Andrew's in the Square was started in 1739 and completed in 1757, making St Andrew's by the Green the fourth-oldest church building in Glasgow by date of starting construction, or third-oldest by date of completion, the earlier two being <link wikipedia="Glasgow_Cathedral" osm="5761459" type="relation">Glasgow Cathedral</link> and the Trongate steeple. The design was produced by Andrew Hunter, himself a Presbyterian, and construction undertaken by masons Andrew Hunter and William Paul, and wright Thomas Thomson.[1][3] Hunter was called before his Kirk Session and ex-communicated from the Church for producing the work. The entire cost of the building was £1,250 12s 9½d, comprising £90 5s 0d for purchase of the site, £420 6s 5d for stonework and £740 1s 4½d on the interior.[4] Because of the church's situation by a low-lying part of <link wikipedia="Glasgow_Green" osm="4548397" type="way">Glasgow Green</link>, it frequently fell victim to flooding before the parkland was eventually levelled to protect it from the river.[3]

The tower is thought to date from the 14th century.  In the 16th century the clerestory was added.  The church was restored between 1856 and 1859 when the walls of the aisles, the tower and the porch were rebuilt and a vestry was added; the architect was Edward Browning of Stamford.  The vestry was rebuilt in 1897, and the porch and part of the south aisle were rebuilt in 1906.  In 1911 the vestry was modified to form the organ chamber.[6]

Built between 1885 and 1886 in the Early English Gothic style by Sir Arthur Blomfield, "one of the last great Gothic revivalists",[1] the church was embroiled in controversy as soon as it was founded.  During a period of religious unrest in the town, theological tensions within Anglicanism between High church Anglo-Catholics and Low church Anglicans were inflamed by what the latter group saw as the church's "idolatrous" Roman Catholic-style fittings—in particular, a statue of the <link wikipedia="Mary,_mother_of_Jesus" osm="2363258019 6262336190" type="node node">Virgin Mary</link> which was seized upon by opponents as an example of a reversion to Catholic-style worship in the Church of England.  The "Worthing Madonna" dispute[2] delayed the consecration of the church by several years.

In 1545, a French invasion force attempted this against a force of the Isle of Wight Militia commanded by Sir John Fyssher – which allegedly included several women archers- and were routed.
In 1940, the radar station was bombed by Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers, which is reconstructed in the film "The Battle of Britain". The top is surmounted by a round barrow.

Donatists argued that Christian clergy must be faultless for their ministry to be effective and their prayers and sacraments to be valid. Donatism had its roots in the long-established Christian community of the Roman Africa province (now <link wikipedia="Algeria" osm="432424926 192756" type="node relation">Algeria</link> and <link wikipedia="Tunisia" osm="424317315 192757" type="node relation">Tunisia</link>) in the persecutions of Christians under Diocletian.
