The local congregation probably used the private chapel at the Archiepiscopal Palace nearby until the church was rebuilt between 1410 and 1420.

In 1859, Fitzsimons added a new wing to the college in order to cater for the increased number of students. The same year, Springfield affiliated to the newly established University of London as a preparatory college. In 1862, financial difficulties caused Fitzsimons to terminate his connection with Springfield, and under his successor the College changed directions sharply. The affiliation with the University of London was dropped for one with Newman's Catholic University in Dublin.

It is part of Camberwell Deanery within the Anglican Diocese of Southwark in the Church of England. The church is dedicated to Saint Giles, the patron saint of the disabled. A local legend associates the dedication of St Giles with a well near Camberwell Grove, which may also have given Camber-well its name. An article on the church from 1827 states: "it has been conjectured that the well might have been famous for some medicinal virtues and might have occasioned the dedication of the church to this patron saint of cripples".[1]

In former times it was commercially dependent on fishing. The decline in fishing, however, caused a shift in commercial emphasis, and the town is now primarily a popular seaside resort, notably achieving the title of Best UK Seaside Town from the British Travel Awards in both 2010 and 2011.[2][3][4] St Ives was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1639.[5][6] St Ives has become renowned for its number of artists. It was named best seaside town of 2007 by The Guardian newspaper.[7] It should not be confused with St Ive, a village and civil parish in south-east Cornwall.

There has been a church on the site for at least 900 years, however the original date of construction is unknown.[1] It is claimed that there is a tunnel from the church to the Friarage in the grounds Yarm School. It is alleged that it was originally used as an escape tunnel for the monks when the Yarm School area was a catholic house. The Dominican Friars, Black Friars, occupied a site in Yarm from 1286 to 1583.
It is part of a long history and many more are buried in the church yard than there are gravestones for - some graves marked with just one name actually contain up to four people, since people have been buried there for hundreds and hundreds of years, grave stones only being introduced recently. 
There are also legends of spirits of the deceased buried in the cemetery, two gardeners, father and son, and the former owner of The Bluebell in Yarm. When you enter the church, directly to the left of the porch is an Anglo-Saxon coffin top that was discovered on-site and inside there are many more historical wonders from all dates.

A devastating fire in 1991 seriously affected the art collection and burnt out the hall itself, and was followed by a prize winning refurbishment and further extension.

      <p id="GL543_363_002" num_links="3">St Leonard's Mill was built in 1760, originally standing in Iham. It was shown at that site on the 1808 Ordnance Survey map, and was still there in 1813. By 1823 the mill had been moved to the new site, which was on the remains of St Leonard's <link wikipedia="Church_(building)" osm="253234529 6377990711 681499085" type="node node way">church</link>. An accident when fitting a new stock to the mill in 1861 resulted in the death of Benjamin King, millwright. The mill was working until the 1890s and was derelict by the 1920s. It was repaired in 1935 and dummy sails fitted, which did not last long. The mill was again repaired in 1955. The <link wikipedia="National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty" osm="143436969" type="way">National Trust</link> became custodians of the mill in 1975. In February 1978, the back of the mill was blown out in a gale.[1] The windmill was blown down on the morning of 16 October 1987.[2] The wreckage of the mill was still to be seen on site the following March. One of the millstones was salvaged and used in the restoration of <link wikipedia="Lowfield_Heath_Windmill" osm="603903927" type="node">Lowfield Heath Windmill</link>.[3] The site of the windmill is now marked by Winchelsea's Millennium Beacon.[4]

The tower was probably built by Gundulf, the Bishop of Rochester, between 1077 and 1108. It was a three-storey building, constructed of local stone, and would have stood at least 22 metres (72 ft) high. At a later point, probably during the English Civil War, the tower was deliberately damaged to prevent it being used for military purposes, and its uppermost storey was demolished. Concerns grew about the tower's condition in the 20th century and in 1937 it was taken into the guardianship of the state. In the 21st century, it is managed by English Heritage and the exterior is open to visitors.

The congregation was originally independent (not linked to any Christian denomination) before taking up Presbyterianism, and worshipped in a private house from its founding in 1853 until a permanent church was provided in 1857; this was one of the oldest Presbyterian places of worship in southeast England.  The growth of the community has resulted in several extensions since then, and severe damage caused by the Great Storm of 1987 was quickly repaired—except for the loss of the building's distinctive spire.  The church, along with most other Presbyterian congregations, joined the United Reformed Church when that denomination was formed in 1972.

The church was designed by RJ Withers, a little known architect practising predominantly in the West Country. Withers had previously undertaken alterations to churches in London, and was working at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, when the decision to build St Mary's was taken. With his reputation, according to his obiturist, of building ‘a good cheap type of brick church’, he was the obvious choice to design St Mary's, which was originally intended to act as a servant's church. Other architectural features resulting from the economic construction include low windowless aisles and plain slate roof with a bell cote housing a solitary bell.
