Weakened by additions to the church tower and undermined by burials in and around the church, by the 19th century the building was structurally unsound.

The old church building, formally The Church of St Mary The Virgin (shortened to The Church of St Mary) and known colloquially as Old St Mary's or The Old Parish Church, is at the edge of the village, and is estimated to be around 650 years old. It sits at the crest of the Greensand Ridge, offering views over the surrounding countryside. Its graveyard is a haven for wild flowers and wildlife. After the church moved to the village centre, incorporating various items from the old church building, the old building was converted for use as a mortuary chapel, but in the 1950s it fell into ruin.

The Domesday Book of 1086 notes that 'a church is there' but no other records of that building remain. The church on the site today is a Grade II* listed building, over 600 years old, built around 1360.[1] It is in need of repairs, especially the nave roof, estimated to cost around £250,000. The tower was renovated in 1883–1884 with Harehills Stone, which has now weathered almost black, in stark contrast to the creamy yellow of the rest of the exterior.
Thomas Dealtry, rector of Swillington 1872–1878, is credited with having introduced the habit of throwing confetti at weddings, from his observation of rice thrown at Hindu weddings in his previous position as Archdeacon of Madras.[2] His predecessor, the Rev A. F. A. Woodford, rector 1847–1872, was a noted masonic scholar and publisher, and became Grand Chaplain in 1863. He is credited, in 1886, with passing to William Wynn Westcott the Cipher Manuscripts leading to the formation of the Hermetic order of the Golden Dawn.

It traces its origins back to 1793 when a lay school for boys was established in St.Patrick's College, Carlow in conjunction with the seminary there. In 1847 it was decided that the young pupils in the school should come out to Knockbeg, which had been a gentry estate on the banks of the <link wikipedia="River_Barrow" osm="6122936" type="relation">River Barrow</link> before being purchased by the Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin, in 1892 all lay students were moved to Knockbeg. The initial school had about 40 pupils but the numbers grew as all the lay pupils from St Patrick's transferred out. In 1898 the school became the official junior seminary for the diocese. To this day the aim of the college is to offer a holistic Catholic education. Through the years the boarding numbers in the school built up to the around 160 mark and has since increased in the 1980s when Day-Boys were taken in. At present, there are well over 350 pupils attending the school.[2]

The entrance was not allowed to open on to the highway and Catholic worshippers were required to arrive at the chapel one at a time.  The church was originally set back discreetly from the road, concealed by a row of cottages.  The cottages were demolished in Bucknall's rebuilding, after discrimination against Catholics had been eased.[6]

It contained 76 skeletons from the late 7th or early 8th century.

It stood on a promontory about 37 m north of the present-day church, more or less where the belvedere overlooking the river now is. The church was slightly separate from the early riverside settlement in Old Woolwich. From the early 10th till the mid-12th century Woolwich was ruled by the abbots of St. Peter's Abbey in <link wikipedia="Ghent" osm="1668655163 897671" type="node relation">Ghent</link>, probably as a result of a gift from Ælfthryth, daughter of King Alfred and Countess of Flanders.

The Basilica's classical portico and three domes are an admired feature of the Oamaru townscape and the building is particularly noted for the high quality of the stone carving and fine plasterwork of its architectural features.[2] The Basilica "must surely have one of the most noble church interiors in the country. Built entirely of Oamaru stone the exterior has weathered more than one would have expected, but inside the church glows with reflected light from the creamy stone which is virtually in its original state." "The interior is bathed in abundant natural light, and with clear glass rather than stained in the high nave windows, the quality of light is enhanced."[3]

In 1991, the building was closed due to maintenance and safety concerns. The Parochial Church Council (PCC) and the locals were determined to see that the church remained open and, in fact, was improved. The "A New Heart for Bow" project was born. More than £3,000,000 was raised from more than a dozen sources and philanthropies. Matthew Lloyd Architects was appointed to refurbish the building and enable it to serve the wider community as well as the church. Originally designed to seat 600 worshippers, the worship space was reordered, retaining original features and furnishings, to seat approximately 150. A  'building within a building' was inserted in the nave: a four-storey steel frame clad in tulipwood is supported on curving steel columns to sit above the worship space. Dubbed the Ark, this insertion in effect adds two new floors to accommodate flexible community spaces. In the attic, above the Ark, a ‘universal access’ gymnasium has been inserted along with an office and changing rooms. Balfour Beatty served as the main contractor, and work began in March 2003 and ended over a year later, in May 2004.[2]

Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the City after the Great Fire of London.[2][page needed] The cathedral building largely destroyed in the Great Fire, now often referred to as Old St Paul's Cathedral, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St. Paul's Churchyard being the site of St. Paul's Cross.

The present church, by local architect John Carr, was completed in 1794. It is a prominent local landmark and has been designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.[2]

Construction was estimated to cost £20,000, but the final figure was only £5,012.[4] (equivalent to £770,000 in 2018).[5] This was because many of the materials were donated and transported to the site at no cost.

In past years St Philip's marsh was a housing development for the workers of Bristol's market area (now known as Old Market).  One of St Philip's' more influential residents during the early 1900s was George Townsend, a major property developer of the South Bristol area.  His family home situated in the St Anne's area of Bristol is still standing today and a reminder of Bristol's history. Today there is very little housing in the area making it almost deserted at night, and other than the retail area it does contain one shop, pub, takeaway and Sparke Evans Park.

      <p id="GL544_458_002" num_links="2">The site on which the current church stands was used as a place of worship under the patronage of Thomas the Apostle as early as the sixth century.  In the ninth century, Bishop Adelochus established a magnificent church with adjoining school, however both burned down in 1007, and again in 1144.  In 1196, construction began on the façade of a new, fortress-like building with an imposing steeple, built in the Roman style.  Interrupted several times, the building work was completed in 1521, in the style of the late Gothic. Around 1450, the church commissioned a set of oil on panel paintings dedicated to the Passion of Jesus. Most of the surviving panels of this once scattered set are now kept in the <link wikipedia="Staatliche_Kunsthalle_Karlsruhe" osm="7707245" type="relation">Staatliche Kunsthalle</link> in <link wikipedia="Karlsruhe" osm="240120582 62518" type="node relation">Karlsruhe</link>, which is why the anonymous master who painted them earned the notname of ″Master of the Karlsruhe Passion″. It is assumed that he is identical with the painter Hans Hirtz, recorded in Strasbourg before 1460.

Only the chancel of the old church survived in its harbourside location of "sequestered leafiness",[1] resembling a cemetery chapel in the middle of its graveyard.  It was rededicated to St Wilfrid—7th-century founder of a now vanished cathedral at Selsey—and served as a chapel of ease until the Diocese of Chichester declared it redundant in 1990.  Since then it has been in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust charity.
