The bare rugged mountains of Gaissene to the southeast contrast with the ancient undulating landscape to the north and west.  The park was originally established in 1970, conserving a 98-square-kilometre (38 sq mi) area of forest surrounding the river.  In 2002, the park was vastly expanded to cover a total of 747 square kilometres (288 sq mi).[2]

The site was documented in the late 19th century, but today it is considered inaccessible.

Originally built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the stadium's name was recommended by Michel Platini, head of the organising committee. On 12 July 1998, France defeated Brazil 3–0 in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final contested at the stadium. It will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the athletics events at the 2024 Summer Olympics. It will also host matches for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

This would eventually serve as the ground where the stadium was constructed.  Between 1906 and 1914, the pitch had been used by another team, FC Frankonia, and several lawsuits were necessary to evict that team from the ground.[1] Construction eventually proceeded and was completed in 1921 with a capacity of 30,000. During the 1938 FIFA World Cup, La Meinau hosted a first round game that saw Brazil eliminate Poland 6–5 after extra-time thanks to a hat-trick by Leônidas who scored one of the very first Bicycle kicks in the history of football.

1266 Ottokar II of Bohemia conquered and devastated the whole region. After that Reichenstein with Stadlern belonged to Bohemia to the earls of Hostau.
1333 the Stadlern was sold to earl Ulrich of Leuchtenberg - this is where Stadlern is for the first time mentioned in written form.
1425 and 1431 ravaged the Hussites Stadlern.
Stadlern changed often its owner and was eventually 1803 sold to the earl of Du Moulin-Eckart to whom it belongs until today.
All these centuries Stadlern was inhabited by <link wikipedia="Bavaria" osm="473848012 2145268" type="node relation">Bavarians</link> but was a Bohemian fief. Finally as a result of the Peace of Pressburg in 1805 Stadlern came to Bavaria.[2]

The Kilmartin River runs northwards through the village. From where it reaches the sea a rocky shore leads east to a slipway at An Corran. Here a local resident found a slab bearing a dinosaur track, probably made by a small ornithopod. Experts subsequently found more dinosaur prints of up to 50 cm, the largest found in Scotland, made by a creature similar to Megalosaurus. At about 160 million years old they are the youngest dinosaur remains to be found in Scotland.[1][2]

The village takes its name from the former river crossing to the north of the village, this was a crossing through the mudflats which was marked with stakes to give an idea of the water depth, hence the name Stakeford. The river crossing has long gone, but remains of the stakes can be seen in the river bed becoming visible whenever the dam downstream is opened.  The old river crossing was replaced by a bridge in the early 20th century, which in itself was replaced by the new Stakeford Bridge in 1994. There is now no trace of the original ford due to the mudflats being used as a landfill site in the 1950s and 60s and the creation of a riverside country park in the 1970s.

Standardville was established after coal was discovered in the area in 1912. The layout of the town was so well-planned, it became the "standard" for all mining towns to follow, which resulted in the town name of Standardville. In 1922, a group of striking miners killed a mine guard and wounded two miners before escaping. In 1930, 20 miners were killed in a mine explosion caused by carbon monoxide gas. In 1950, the mine shut down and people began to relocate elsewhere. A couple families remained until the 1970s, after which Standardville was abandoned.

On June 14, 1922, several miners went on strike and attacked a train carrying several new miners from both sides. The striking miners then fled and were pursued by mine guards. The shooting that occurred killed a mine guard and wounded two others.[4]
