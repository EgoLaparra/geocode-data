A reliquary found in the high altar was a gift from Bishop Gisike of Odense (1286–1300), possibly a gift for the reconsecration of the altar on the completion of the apse which is just slightly older than the chancel. From the 14th century, the church was the property of the Crown but from the beginning of the 16th century, it was administered by Engelborg Manor on <link wikipedia="Nakskov_Fjord" osm="8727743" type="relation">Nakskov Fjord</link>.

The segmental arch bridge is 92 feet (28 m) long and built with sandstone. The bridge was built in the 1890s to facilitate Danville's expansion during an industrial boom. As various geographic and political limitations prevented the city from expanding in any directions but east and southeast, the city grew over Stony Creek, necessitating a new bridge. Mayor John Beard commissioned the bridge; during the 1890s, Beard and political rival John Cannon clashed over many issues, and Beard most likely built the bridge to demonstrate his political effectiveness. The bridge is the only segmented arch bridge remaining in east-central Illinois and is one of five stone arch bridges in the region.[2]

      <p id="GL551_092_001" num_links="2">Westerly Road Church was founded at the initiative of two sisters, Helen and Dorothy Harris, with the support of their brother W. Butler Harris, on land along Westerly Road which they donated to the church.[2]  The Harris siblings were the children of noted Princeton Professor Walter Butler Harris,[3] and grandchildren of the Rev. William Harris, a treasurer of Princeton University.[4]  The Harris siblings, along with many of the early members of Westerly Road, including Elmer Engstrom,[5] were previously communicants of <link wikipedia="Nassau_Presbyterian_Church" osm="141253165" type="way">First Presbyterian Church</link> but were dissatisfied with its theological direction under the Rev. Dr. John R. Bodo.[6]  Their intention was to have a church where Biblical teaching and missionary activity were emphasized.  The original structure cost $30,000, raised by the 22 charter members,[7]  and was bought pre-fabricated from U.S. Steel Homes Inc.  The sanctuary arrived via train at the <link wikipedia="Princeton_Junction_station" osm="2069282000" type="node">Princeton Junction Train Station</link> and was trucked to the site at Westerly and Wilson Roads on the border of the former Princeton Borough and Princeton Township.[8]  At the time of construction, the roads were not yet put through and there was no opposition to the church's request for a zoning variance to allow for a religious use in a residential zone.  The Harris siblings arranged to call the Rev. Edward H. Morgan of Roanoke, VA, their cousin, as the first pastor, a position which he would hold until his retirement in 1980.  The parsonage was built at 25 Westerly Road, which would later serve as the church offices until the relocation to 1025 Bunn Drive.  The first services were held on November 25, 1956 with 100 in attendance at the morning service and 30 at the evening.[9]

After the demise of the town of Kincardine, which was gradually abandoned after the destruction of its royal castle in the Wars of Independence, the Scottish Parliament made Stonehaven the successor county town of Kincardineshire. Stonehaven had grown around an Iron Age fishing village, now the "Auld Toon" ("old town"), and expanded inland from the seaside.  As late as the 16th century, old maps indicate the town was called Stonehyve,  Stonehive, Pont also adding the alternative Duniness.[2] It is known informally to locals as Stoney.

The land had been acquired from the Native American tribes in two parts based on a treaty line that ran southeast to northwest. Known as the "Ten O’Clock Treaty Line" and later referred to as the “Indian Boundary Line,” the land southwest of the line was obtained in 1809 in the Treaty of Fort Wayne (1803) known as “Harrison’s Purchase". The land northeast of the line was obtained in 1818 in the Treaty of St. Mary’s, known as the “New Purchase.”[3] The area encompassing the village of Story was opened to European settlement on September 30, 1809. The so-called “Ten O’clock Treaty” opened three million acres (12,000 km²) to settlement, the boundary being a line running from Raccoon Creek on the <link wikipedia="Wabash_River" osm="2248546" type="relation">Wabash River</link> near Montezuma to Seymour, marked by a shadow cast at 10:00 a.m. each September 30.

It was established by municipal ordinance under the New Orleans City Council, to regulate prostitution. Sidney Story, a city alderman, wrote guidelines and legislation to control prostitution within the city. The ordinance designated a thirty-eight block area as the part of the city in which prostitution, although still nominally illegal, was tolerated or regulated. The area was originally referred to as "The District", but its nickname, "Storyville", soon caught on, much to the chagrin of Alderman Story.[1][page needed] It was bound by the streets of North Robertson, Iberville, Basin, and St. Louis Streets. It was located by a train station, making it a popular destination for travelers throughout the city, and became a centralized attraction in the heart of New Orleans. Only a few of its remnants are now visible. The neighborhood lies in Faubourg Tremé and the majority of the land was repurposed for public housing.

Around 1875 the name was changed to Texas Hill, after a group of emigrants from Texas who were supposedly killed in the area.[1] In 1882-83 Oscar F. Thornton emigrated from California and established a farming community near the station. Due to the fertility of the farmland, he named his community Christvale.[3] Thornton became the first postmaster of the Christvale post office when it was established on September 25, 1888.[1] Railroad personnel did not like the name, however, and shortened it to Chrystoval (or Crystoval). With the advent of the telegraph, the name was further shortened to its present-day Stoval in approximately 1911, in order to save on telegraphing. After closing down at some point, the post office was re-established on May 21, 1914, under the name of Stoval.[3]  It has an estimated elevation of 400 feet (120 m) above sea level.[1]
