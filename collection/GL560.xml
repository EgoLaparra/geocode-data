The first suggests it derives from the Greek island of <link wikipedia="Chios" osm="3188280 5305858" type="relation relation">Chios</link>, and the second that it was named after Scio, New York, although that town was also named for Chios.[10] Thirdly, by coincidence scio also means "I know" in Latin, so following the American Civil War some people assumed this was the origin of the name.[citation needed]

      <p id="GL560_283_001" num_links="5">According to Scottsville's website, the town "served as Virginia's westernmost center of government and commerce during the 1700s, when rivers were the primary means of travel in the new American wilderness." During the late 18th and the 19th centuries attempts were made to improve navigability along the James, as well as other central Virginian rivers. Part of this was the construction of a canal running roughly parallel with the James west from <link wikipedia="Richmond,_Virginia" osm="2592301390 3864712" type="node relation">Richmond</link>. Scottsville was the largest port town along this route, called the James River and Kanawha Canal. The ultimate goal of this project was to connect the <link wikipedia="Atlantic_Ocean" osm="305640306" type="node">Atlantic</link> with the <link wikipedia="Ohio_River" osm="2182501" type="relation">Ohio River</link> via the <link wikipedia="Kanawha_River" osm="2182498" type="relation">Kanawha River</link>. These aims were not achieved, due to interruption by the American Civil War and the efficiency of the railroads. It did however succeed in making Scottsville a busy, prominent town. In fact, thanks to a wagon road connecting <link wikipedia="Staunton,_Virginia" osm="157572900 206646 3864617" type="node relation relation">Staunton</link> to Scottsville, all of the agricultural wealth of the Shenandoah Valley poured into town en route to Richmond and the sea, thereby making Scottsville the largest grain market in the state. Trade was disrupted when Union soldiers broke the canal works in the area. Then the train came, the tracks being laid directly on the towpath of the old canal, a monument to its demise. Eventually, the train too stopped taking passengers, leaving Scottsville a sleepy country town on a coal line.

Although he had intended for it to be used by the university to expand its facilities, the <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">Second World War</link> in Europe had caused the college’s enrollment to decline precipitously and made such expansions unnecessary.[2] After renovations were completed, the high school was opened in 1944 for young Catholic men.[4] The Annex served as the high school’s home until 1961 when the construction of an expressway necessitated a move to a new location.[5] After making the Old Main Building of the University of Scranton its temporary home for two years, Prep moved to its permanent location, the former Women’s Institute Building of the International Correspondence Schools, at 1000 Wyoming Avenue.[3]

Another tradition was, however, extant, which ascribed its foundation to Ulysses.[7] 
But no historical value can be attached to such statements, and there is no trace in historical times of Scylletium having been a Greek colony, still less an Athenian one. Its name is not mentioned either by Scylax or Scymnus Chius in enumerating the Greek cities in this part of Italy, nor is there any allusion to its Athenian origin in Thucydides at the time of the Athenian expedition to <link wikipedia="Sicily" osm="1781917332 39152" type="node relation">Sicily</link>. We learn from Diodorus[8] that it certainly did not display any friendly feeling towards the Athenians.

Like the <link wikipedia="Mediterranean_Sea" osm="305640275" type="node">Mediterranean Sea</link>, it has almost no tides due to its nearly complete enclosure from the Pacific Ocean.[1] This isolation also reflects in the fauna species and in the water salinity, which is lower than in the ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%.

Seager Wheeler's Maple Grove Farm  was a farm owned and operated by agronomist Seager Wheeler  (1868–1961) "Wheat King of the Prairies" or "The Wheat Wizard of Rosthern" who developed dry land farming techniques as well as fruit and wheat strains which could grow in a short prairie growing season followed by harsh winters.[1]  Seager came to Canada in 1885 and applied for his own homestead in 1890.  His original homestead was located at NE Section 16 Township 38 Range 4 West of the 3rd Meridian, and he was aided by a loan from the Temperance Colonization Society Limited - Toronto[2][3]  Whereas the nearest present day town of <link wikipedia="Rosthern" osm="29814283" type="node">Rosthern</link>, <link wikipedia="Saskatchewan" osm="4493451168 391178" type="node relation">Saskatchewan</link>[4] is located at Sec.35, Twp.42, R.3, W3.

Five separate entries of wheat which were grown at this farm location during 1911 to 1918 won World Wheat Championships.  Morris Bodnar, Member of Parliament for Saskatoon—Dundurn, commemorated Seager Wheeler's Maple Grove Farm as a National Historic Site of Canada on August 3, 1996[5]  The site is honoured as the location where hardy wheat and fruit strains were developed which were well suited to the prairie climate and growing season.
