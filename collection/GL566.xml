In early 1971 a student of Trungpa Rinpoche, Jonathan Eric, inherited $100,000 from an uncle.  He gave the money to Trungpa and Karma Dzong, and it was used to purchase what became the Rocky Mountain Dharma Center (now called Shambhala Mountain Center), as well as Tail of the Tiger in Barnet, Vermont (now called Karme Chöling).

People have been living in this area before European settlers came in. The village was established in 1895 when gold was discovered in the area.  It was originally known as Abercorn but was changed to avoid confusion with Abercorn (now <link wikipedia="Mbala,_Zambia" osm="369007774" type="node">Mbala</link>) in <link wikipedia="Zambia" osm="432425123 195271" type="node relation">Zambia</link>. The name Shamva is derived from Tsamvi a tree common in that region. Early settlers could not pronounce Tsamvi hence changed it to Shamva. In the First Chimurenga many of the settlers died in an attack on the village. The railway arrived in the town in 1913.It is also where many African people died in fight for the struggle of independence.
A vast majority of the population survives through gold panning. The area is rich in alluvial gold and most of it is found along the Mazowe basin. Gold panning is the greatest threat to the environment in the area. Shamva residents get their water supply from Mazowe river which runs about 5 km from Wadzanai Township.

These individuals were uncovered amongst a Mousterian layer accompanied by various stone tools and animal remains.  The cave also contains two later "proto-Neolithic" cemeteries, one of which dates back about 10,600 years and contains 35 individuals.[6]
