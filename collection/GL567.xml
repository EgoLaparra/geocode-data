In 206 BCE, it was officially established as a county, but instead named as Sha County (沙縣), but not long after[when?], was renamed to its present name. In the early part of the Eastern Han, it was renamed State of Shehou (涉侯國), part of the Wei Commandery (魏郡). The Jin Dynasty (265–420) saw the area as part of Guangping Commandery (廣平國). The present name was restored again during the Sui Dynasty, becoming part of Shangdang Commandery. However, in the early Tang, it was renamed Mo County (漠縣).

Originally called Shea's Buffalo, it was opened in 1926 to show silent movies. It took one year to build the entire theatre.

      <p id="GL567_084_003" num_links="2">Shea's Buffalo, flagship of the theater chain, was designed by the noted firm of Rapp and Rapp of <link wikipedia="Chicago" osm="153388690 122604" type="node relation">Chicago</link>. Modeled in a combination of Spanish and French Baroque and Rococo styles, the theatre was designed to resemble opera houses and palaces of Europe of the 17th and 18th centuries.  Originally the seating accommodated nearly 4,000 people, but several hundred seats were removed in the 1930s to make more comfortable accommodations in the orchestra area; there are now 3,019 seats at Shea's.  The interior was designed by world-renowned designer/artist Louis Comfort Tiffany with most of the elements still in place today. Many of the furnishings and fixtures were supplied by Marshall Field in Chicago, and included immense Czechoslovakian crystal chandeliers of the finest quality.  The interior contained over 1-acre (4,000 m2) of seating. The cost of construction and outfitting of the theater in 1926 was just over $1.9 million.  This was at a time when a new house could be purchased for $3,000 and a new Model A <link wikipedia="Ford_Motor_Company" osm="170973946 232375504" type="way way">Ford</link> was $1,000.  The theater opened January 16, 1926 with the film King of Main Street, starring Adolphe Menjou.  When Michael Shea retired in 1930, Shea's interests were headed by V. R. McFaul, who owned and managed several dozen Shea's Theaters in the metro Buffalo area until his death in 1955.  Loew's Theatres took over the chain's interests in 1948.[2]

Because of its proximity to UCLA, it was intended for and has been used primarily for student occupancy. In their book An Architectural Guidebook to Los Angeles, David Gebhard and Robert Winter praised its functionality by noting, "each apartment [is] completely separated from the others . . . with its own terraces, decks, and outdoor garden space."

Typical of Lautner's work, the project was approached from an idea and a unique structure was derived that solved the challenges of the site.

Bells were never installed in the clock-tower, but in 2002 an electronic bell sound system was added to provide hourly strikes and Westminster-style quarter chimes.[2]

Based on the numerous artifacts they found, he estimated the earliest occupation date of about 30,000 years BP. He noted there were Paleo-Indian and Archaic artifacts, primarily scrapers and blades, dating to about 12,000 BP.

The community remained agricultural until the advent of the railroad in 1849, with its center of industry a mile to the southeast at Shelburne Falls.  The village's greatest period of development was between about 1880 and 1910, when industry developed near the railroad, and the town benefited from the philanthropy of the <link wikipedia="Shelburne_Museum" osm="188662505" type="way">Shelburne Museum</link>'s founders, William Seward Webb and Electra Havemeyer Webb.[2]

      <p id="GL567_219_002" num_links="2">In 1873, Civil War veteran Horace A. Cowles set up the Cyclone post office in his home one mile east and one mile south of present-day Shelby. In 1879, with the coming of the railroad, a second post office named Arcade was established one mile east of the present site of Shelby. In the winter of 1880, the post office was moved again a mile west to where Shelby is today. Postal authorities objected to the name "Arcade" due to confusion with the town of <link wikipedia="Arcadia,_Nebraska" osm="151460911 169384" type="node relation">Arcadia</link> in <link wikipedia="Loup_County,_Nebraska" osm="1425392" type="relation">Loup County</link>. In search of a new name for the settlement, the people chose "Shelby", after the name of an official with the Omaha and Republican Valley Railway (a branch of the Union Pacific).[7] The land which Arcade was established on was owned by Gilbert Van Vorce and Peter Matter. Seeing a need for a trade center in the area, these men gave the railroad company half interest in their property and the town was established. After the railroad retained its 200 feet (61 m) on each side and closest to the tracks, eight blocks were located on each side parallel to the tracks. The original streets are still present and retain the names of Walnut, Elm, Chestnut, Pine, Cherry, and Oak.

The city was chartered in 1843 and named after Colonel Isaac Shelby, a hero of the battle of Kings Mountain (1780) during the American Revolution. Shelby was agricultural until the railways in the 1870s stimulated Shelby’s development. Textiles later became its chief industry during the 1920s when production of cotton in <link wikipedia="Cleveland_County,_North_Carolina" osm="2528688" type="relation">Cleveland County</link> rose from 8,000 to 80,000 bales a year. Cotton production peaked in 1948 with Cleveland County producing 83,549 bales, making it North Carolina's premier cotton county. In the 1930s, Shelby was known as “the leading shopping center between Charlotte and Asheville”  People from surrounding counties came to Shelby to shop, since there were numerous types of local and chain stores. By 1947, Shelby was a true thriving town with the mills paying among the highest wages in the South. In the 1950s, droughts, insect infestations, and government acreage controls resulted in the decline of cotton as Cleveland County's primary crop. [6]

Anton Corbine carried mail in to them from Flambeau by foot or by horse. Other settlers followed. Woodlawn Cemetery was started in 1903 with the burial of Mrs. A. Elmendorf. A little log school stood just south of it, and a Rev. Willam would sometimes follow the trails up from Huron to lead worship in the school. In 1905 Max Dietze from Hawkins built a general store east of the cemetery, supplied by driving a wagon with horses across the <link wikipedia="Jump_River" osm="5311723" type="relation">Jump</link> and along logging roads to Holcombe or <link wikipedia="Chippewa_Falls,_Wisconsin" osm="151476737 251904" type="node relation">Chippewa</link>.

He used a special design by the Iowa State Highway Commission (ISHC), and completed the project in late 1915 for $6,081.06.[2]  The ISHC designed plain bridges for its rural spans, but because this span is in town it features decorative elements: bichrome concrete detailing, molded concrete balustrades, and incised spandrel panels.  The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[1]

The town occupied an area of six hectares. It appears that Shengavit was a societal center for the areas surrounding the town due to its unusual size, evidence of surplus production of grains, and metallurgy, as well as its monumental 4 meter wide stone wall. Three smaller village sites of Moukhannat Tepe, Khorumbulagh, and Tairov have been identified and were located outside the walls of Shengavit.  Its pottery makes it a type site of the Kura-Araxes or Early Transcaucasian Period and the Shengavitian culture area.[1]
