Theatre construction occurred between 1871 and 1873, with a design by the French architects P. Chauderlot and F. Festau. It had a capacity of 2,500 people. 
The theatre opened on 23 March 1873 and featured the company of actor Manuel Catalina.[1] A comedy playhouse, it went through difficult times in its early days due to its relative distance from the then city center and the high ticket price. The Apolo and the Felipe theatres were the most important venues for the género chico, a phenomenon which debuted in Madrid and featured one-act performances.[2] The Apolo closed its doors on 30 June 1929 after it was purchased by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, which demolished the theatre in order to construct its Madrid headquarters. The site now contains a building which houses the Department of Finance and Administration of the City of Madrid.

Privately owned theatres with limited seating capacity had existed in the city for many years, but the arrival of Cardinal Spinelli, the new papal envoy, in 1786 spurred the  construction of a new public theatre under the architects Cosimo Morelli and Antonio Foschini.  However, their disagreements led to conflicting design concepts regarding the elliptical shape of the auditorium which were resolved through compromise.  The theatre was finally ready for its inaugural presentation of Portogallo’s Gli Orazi e i Curiazi on 2 September 1798.

      <p id="GL569_047_001" num_links="4">By the end of the 18th century, the need for a new theatre in Trieste became evident. Its main theatre, the Teatro di San Pietro, had become increasingly inadequate and finally closed its doors in 1800. A proposal to the Austrian Chancery from Giovanni Matteo Tommasini to build a private theatre had existed since 1795 and, in June 1798, a contract was drawn up whereby annual funding would come from the municipality and Tommasini would hold the rights to several boxes and the rights to sell others. Gian Antonio Selva, the architect of the <link wikipedia="La_Fenice" osm="251501878" type="node">La Fenice</link> in <link wikipedia="Venice" osm="64778090 44741" type="node relation">Venice</link>, was engaged, and he designed a classic horseshoe-shaped auditorium.  However, his exterior designs were considered to be too plain for the Austrians who then engaged another architect, Matteo Pertsch, to solve the problem, which was accomplished by incorporating elements of <link wikipedia="Milan" osm="62505581 44915" type="node relation">Milan</link>'s <link wikipedia="La_Scala" osm="6552704" type="relation">La Scala</link> opera house.

After the exposition the theatre had a mixed history. It suffered damage from fire and flood. At times it was closed and at times was partially restored and reopened. The building has been used as a hospital and as a trade show venue. Following its most recent renovation the theatre has become one of Seville's most important centres for cultural events.

He moved to the nearby city of Mayaguez where he established himself as one of the pioneers of the industry of cinematography in the island of Puerto Rico, introducing this new form of Visual Art early in the beginning of the 20th century by showing silent films throughout the nearby towns and becoming the exclusive distributor for 'Nicholas Power Co.' movie projectors throughout the Caribbean islands.

Born in the Ohio Country (present-day <link wikipedia="Ohio" osm="316982774 162061" type="node relation">Ohio</link>), and growing up during the American Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War, Tecumseh was exposed to warfare and envisioned the establishment of an independent Native American nation east of the <link wikipedia="Mississippi_River" osm="1756854" type="relation">Mississippi River</link> under British protection.

The continental divide passes through the state, meaning there is drainage toward both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Most of the drainage toward the Gulf is represented by the Papaloapan and Coatzacoalcos Rivers and their tributaries such as the Grande and Salado Rivers. Three rivers account for most of the water headed for the Pacific: the Atoyac River, Mixteco River, and the Tehuantepec River, with their tributaries.[1]

The site of the city, palace and citadel together measure over 0.45 km2 (110 acres).[1] The name Karmir Blur translates to "Red Hill" because of the hill's reddish hue. It became this color after the city was set on fire and the upper walls which were made of tuff fell and crumbled because of the heat. After the tuff was heated by the fire, it took on a more intense red color and therefore the hill became red. The lower portions of the walls were left standing after the fire since they were built with a stronger stone. Teishebaini is situated at a height of 901 metres (2,956 ft).[2]

Despite being positioned at the top of a cliff, the wooden structure was not high enough. In 1882, it was therefore repositioned on a round base. The owner, Peter Mikkelsen, took advantage of the move to replace the old sails with new ones complete with adjustable flaps. Unlike most post mills, the sails rotate anticlockwise. Mikkelsen also enlarged the mill, both in height and depth. His son operated the mill until 1941 when Foreningen Bornholm took it over to ensure its upkeep. By 2000, the mill was no longer able to function properly as a result of trees and buildings in the surroundings. In 2006, it was therefore decided it should be moved to Landbrugsmuseet Melstedgård where it was inaugurated in 2009.[2][1]

The towers, commonly called simply the Shoreview Towers by local residents, are owned by Telefarm, Inc., which is a company jointly owned by the Twin Cities stations <link wikipedia="WCCO-TV" osm="119004729" type="way">WCCO</link> channel 4, KSTP channel 5, and KARE channel 11.  The towers are used for both analog and digital television broadcasts, plus the transmission of KSTC channel 45 (owned by the same company as KSTP) and WUCW channel 23.  Some area radio stations also use the facility.  The towers were initially built in the 1970s, and were replacements for a single "candelabra" style tower which collapsed just prior to completion in 1971, killing six workers on the tower and one on the ground.

The town itself was founded in 1878 as "Columbia", but due to confusion with a California town of the same name, was renamed Telluride in 1887 for the gold telluride minerals found in other parts of Colorado. These telluride minerals were never found near Telluride, but the area's mines for some years provided zinc, lead, copper, silver, and other gold ores.

As a result of the Teltow War [de] (1239–1245) the question of territorial lordship of the newly created heart of the expanding march was finally decided here. Between 1835 and 1952 there was also a county, Teltow district [de]; in addition a town immediately south of Berlin, in the present-day county of <link wikipedia="Potsdam-Mittelmark" osm="62353" type="relation">Potsdam-Mittelmark</link>, bears the name <link wikipedia="Teltow" osm="29018503 447979" type="node relation">Teltow</link>.

To the southwest, the countryside around the Pfefferfließ is also counted as part of the Teltow, although it has no clear boundaries. The regional border in the south is unclear, because the ground moraines here were often eroded by urstromtal processes. For example, there are many small island plateaux. The boundary of the cultural landscape is general seen as the Baruth Urstromtal. Further south is the heathland of the Fläming.
