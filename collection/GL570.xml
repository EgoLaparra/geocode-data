The earliest known inhabitands of the area were the Mazahua. It was originally called "Ñiñi Mbate" which probably means 'place of the small plain' but possibly 'place of the first man'. This area was conquered by the Aztecs before the 16th century, and its last Aztec governor was named Ocoyotzen.  When the Spanish invaded, the Mazahuas and the Otomis of this area united with the Aztecs to fight them. However, after the Spanish victory, Hernán Cortés distributed this area, along with <link wikipedia="Metepec" osm="376221384 614481541" type="way way">Metepec</link> to Francisco de Villegas in 1540. In 1535, the Franciscans began evangelization here, establishing churches and renaming the area, San Miguel Temascalcingo. Through the 18th century, haciendas here grew to supply grain to mining areas like <link wikipedia="Tlalpujahua" osm="3006000330" type="node">Tlalpujahua</link> and El Oro. Because of a history of mistreatment by colonial authorities, the residents here sided early with Hidalgo when the Mexican War of Independence broke out in 1810. Shortly after the end of the war, the State of Mexico was created in 1824 and the municipality of Temascalcingo in 1825, with San Miguel Temascalcingo as the seat. This area was the scene of a destructive earthquake in 1912. As the birthplace of the painter José María Velasco Gómez, the town changed its name to Temascalcingo de José María Velasco July 14, 1945 by decree.  However, it is still commonly referred to simply as "Temascalcingo". In 1988, a group of residents from Tepeolulco, a community under Temascalcingo's jurisdiction, took over the municipal hall to protest water supplies and civil rights violations.[1]

A petition was circulated and the name Bedford Center was changed to Temperance.[5] During the early years of Temperance, the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages was prohibited.[6]

Eventually, the building fell into disuse by the state other than storage space, and so it was purchased by the Catholic Diocese of Helena, which owns it today and uses it to house their administrative offices.

The church's benefactor, Noël Brûlart de Sillery, an admirer of the <link wikipedia="Pantheon,_Rome" osm="3374342" type="relation">Pantheon</link> in Rome, desired a centralized plan.  Mansart, no doubt also influenced by the chapel of the Château d'Anet, delivered a highly original design with eight interconnected subsidiary spaces surrounding the central 44 feet (13 m) dome[7] including the sanctuary to the south, the vestibule to the north, three chapels, two sacristies, and the nuns' choir to the west.  The design for the exterior was also quite original with the street elevation's three components, the arch with its Michelangelo inspired portal and projecting cross, the toit à l'impèriale with its lantern, and the cross-topped spire, drawing the eye heavenward.[8]  The building's construction was overseen by the master mason contractor Michel Villedo.[9]

Ancient sources disagree on whether it was constructed by Augustus' successor Tiberius and Augustus' widow Livia or by Tiberius alone.[4] It was not until after the death of Tiberius in 37 that the temple was finally completed and dedicated by his successor Caligula. Some scholars have suggested that the delays in completing the temple indicated that Tiberius had little regard for the honours of his predecessor. Others have argued the opposite case, pointing to evidence that Tiberius made his last journey from his villa on <link wikipedia="Capri" osm="2675353" type="relation">Capri</link> with the intention of entering Rome and dedicating the temple.

It is thought that original sanctuary dates to the Old Kingdom. The ruins of the last structure date to the Ptolemy VIII period of the 2nd century BC, although decorations and additions continued to be added centuries later by the Romans. Because of Montu's strong association with raging bulls, the temple was a major centre of worship for bulls, containing many statues of bulls for worship and reliefs. Most of these statues are now located in various museums around the world.

The first settlers who settled in the community had the last names Shelton, Avant, Hank, and Seagler. The community's fertile soil and moist climate made it feasible to grow cotton, and several plantations were established, including the Jackson Plantation, which, at one time, was one of the largest plantations in East Texas. They were extremely successful. A post office was established at Tennessee Colony in 1852. Before the Civil War, as well as after, the community fell victim to racial tensions. Two white men from <link wikipedia="Mississippi" osm="316968897 161943" type="node relation">Mississippi</link> named Cable and Wyrick were accused of plotting a slave uprising in 1860, in which they encouraged slaves to kill most of the community's white residents by poisoning the water supply in the settlement. They were tried and hanged soon after. The nearby city of <link wikipedia="Palestine,_Texas" osm="151781312 114504" type="node relation">Palestine</link> had the community's first railroad built there. As of 1884 Tennessee Colony boasted a population of 200 and three churches, a steam-powered gristmill, and a cotton gin. As the community's businesses moved to the nearby city of <link wikipedia="Palestine,_Texas" osm="151781312 114504" type="node relation">Palestine</link>, the community's population plummeted over the next few decades. There were a few grocers and cotton gins in the area, and it eventually received a telephone connection. It functioned as a small cultural port in the 20th century. The population declined to just 100 people by 1914, rose again to 300 in 1927, but again declined during the 1930s. In 1941 there were 150 people in Tennessee Colony. A total of 21,000 acres of land was purchased just southwest of the settlement by the Texas Department of Corrections in 1965, and the first medium security <link wikipedia="Prison" osm="196399500 8710408" type="way relation">prison</link> facility named the <link wikipedia="Coffield_Unit" osm="359566918" type="way">Coffield Unit</link> was built in the community and held approximately 2,000 prisoners.

The forest consists mainly of Scots pine and Corsican pine. Forestry and Land Scotland, successor body to the Forestry Commission, still owns the forest.
Tentsmuir is a key geomorphological site for the study of active beach and coastal processes, in particular those associated with coastal progradation (shoreline building out seawards). The site supports an extensive and relatively undisturbed area of intertidal sand, mudflats and rapidly accreting lime-poor dunes. There are complete sequences of sand dune and slack communities from strandline, saltmarsh, accreting “yellow” dunes, fixed “grey dunes” to lichen rich dune heath, dune slack and dune slack woodland. Associated with these habitats are a large number of plant and invertebrate species including many of national or regional importance.
