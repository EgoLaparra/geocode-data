      <p id="GL572_004_001" num_links="4">The Teufelsturm (also Butterweckfels or Mittagstein) is a prominent rock tower and climbing rock formed of Elbe Sandstone, about forty metres high in <link wikipedia="Saxon_Switzerland" osm="202443898" type="way">Saxon Switzerland</link> in East Germany. It is located east of the <link wikipedia="Elbe" osm="123822 1940739 1940740" type="relation relation relation">River Elbe</link> on the upper edge of the valley between <link wikipedia="Bad_Schandau" osm="27453044 534534" type="node relation">Schmilka</link> and <link wikipedia="Bad_Schandau" osm="27453044 534534" type="node relation">Bad Schandau</link> in the Schrammsteinen. The Teufelsturm is also referred to as the "Symbol of Saxon Climbing".[1]

</p>
      <p id="GL572_004_002" num_links="2">The oldest name for the peak is probably Butterweck ("Bread and butter") or Butterweckfels, because the summit bears a certain resemblance to a bread roll when seen from a distance, such as from the other bank of the Elbe. The name Teufelsturm was already being used by Wilhelm Leberecht Götzinger in his descriptions of Saxon Switzerland, where he mentioned it as a sundial by the farmers on the plateaux around Schöna and Reinhardtsdorf. The shadow thrown by the Teufelsturm on the rock face behind it - when seen from the direction of Reinhardtsdorf-Schöna - disappears around midday exactly behind the rock tower, which is therefore also called the Mittagstein or Mittagfels (i.e. "Midday Rock"). Another name is Campanile, probably derived from similarly named summits in the <link wikipedia="Dolomites" osm="2139488" type="relation">Dolomites</link> and the <link wikipedia="Brenta_group" osm="2141596" type="relation">Brenta</link>, so-named because of their smooth rock faces and generally rectangular structure of the tower. The name most used today, Teufelsturm ("Devil's Tower") probably arose due to the difficulty of climbing the hill.[2]

The completion of the section between FM 1957 (Potranco Road) to FM 471 (Culebra Road) will finally allow for seamless travel from Hwy 90 at the south end, north to SH 16 (Bandera Road). The improvements to FM 1957 (Potranco Road) will allow for the necessary widening of the two-lane roadway which is dealing with new suburban growth and traffic for which it wasn't built to handle.

      <p id="GL572_126_002" num_links="3">For years there has been a simmering dispute over whether Texline is lawfully a part of Texas or New Mexico.  The straight north-south border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between 2.29 and 3.77 miles too far west of that line. this survey error resulted in the current towns of <link wikipedia="Farwell,_Texas" osm="6595894" type="relation">Farwell</link>, Texline, and a part of Glenrio being within the <link wikipedia="Texas" osm="316998356 114690" type="node relation">State of Texas</link>.  New Mexico's short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was correctly surveyed on the meridian.  New Mexico's draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended.  The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin.  A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the <link wikipedia="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" osm="286501" type="relation">U.S. Supreme Court</link> to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law.

General Thayer was dedicated to hard work, and at the age of 17, he taught in the local schools of Hanover, New Hampshire to earn money to pay for college – an early sign of the importance he attached to teaching and education. He was Superintendent of the Military Academy at West Point from 1817–1833. General Thayer's 1871 will provided for the creation of Thayer Academy, and on September 12, 1877, the Academy opened its doors to 30 students in what is now Main Building. Glover opened sometime later in 1894.  The junior school (grades 5-8), Thayerlands, opened in 1924 and quickly grew to include eight grades as well as kindergarten and nursery school. Beginning in 1969, the lower grades were gradually eliminated, and Thayerlands became Thayer Academy Middle School. Thayer has been a co-educational institution since its founding.

The neighborhood originally got its name, Franklinton, from its founder, Lucas Sullivant. The nickname was originally coined because much of the land lies below the level of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers, and has historically been prone to flooding. The low-lying bottom land was well-suited for farming, with the river serving as a direct connection to the Ohio River. While the "bottoms" has often been used as a pejorative by outlying areas, many long-term residents are proud of the name. Since the early 2000s, the name "Franklinton" has seen a resurgence in use. Among many locals residents, the reversion to Franklinton is often associated with ongoing gentrification efforts.[1] As is often the case with gentrification, "unsavory" names (such as the "bottoms") which anchor community perceptions must first be "euphemized" or otherwise replaced with more marketable alternatives in order to pave the way for commercial development.

The lakes, known as broads, were formed by the flooding of peat workings. The Broads, and some surrounding land, were constituted as a special area with a level of protection similar to a national park by the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988. The Broads Authority, a special statutory authority responsible for managing the area, became operational in 1989.[2]
