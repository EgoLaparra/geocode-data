The opening signaled the beginning of the end for the aging Salisbury Mall, which came about when it became obvious that an extension of the Salisbury bypass from <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_13_in_Maryland" osm="2301100" type="relation">U.S. Route 13</link> north over to <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_50_in_Maryland" osm="3322741" type="relation">U.S. Route 50</link> west was necessary to relieve the downtown congestion. It is no coincidence that The Centre at Salisbury is situated such as it is, at the juncture of two major highways—enjoying on the one hand, local business from U.S. Route 13, and beach traffic from the bypass on the other. The Centre was built at this location with that vision in mind. The Centre opened with anchors Hecht's, Boscov's, JCPenney, Sears, and Montgomery Ward.

Though many were originally kirktowns,[2][3] today they are often thought of as small villages lacking a church, post office, or other formal building.  It is likely that many date to medieval times or earlier – a cluster of small single-storey cottages of farmers and/or fishermen, invariably found on poorer land. They were often related to the rundale system of farming. According to David Lloyd, the Great Famine in Ireland (1845–49) caused such disruption to the social system that the clachans there virtually disappeared[4]; many in the Scottish Highlands were victims of the Clearances. In some cases, they have evolved into holiday villages, or one or two houses have taken over, turning smaller houses into agricultural outhouses.  Remains can be seen in many upland and coastal areas.  Some are clustered in a dip in the landscape, to protect from Atlantic winds, but others stretch haphazardly along main roads.

Originally located on the corner of 2nd and Putnam, the two-story Georgian style home was constructed for Frederick and Rosa Linsell in 1904, by architect John C. Stahl at a cost of $9,000. The Linsells lived there for 10 years before selling it. After serving as a home for two more families, the building was bought by the Detroit Board of Education in the 1930s. In 1939 the building became the Women’s Study Building for the university. It was the only building of 16 on its block that survived the expansion of Wayne State’s campus in the mid 1900s. In 1956 the Board of Education donated the Linsell House to the university and it became the office for the School of Business, and later the Biology Department. In 1987 the house was restored and turned into the Dean’s Office for the College of Fine Performing and Communication Arts. The thirteen-room house is now located at 5104 Gullen Mall, in the middle of the Wayne State campus.

Also, the trough in front of the tomb and the nearby cistern, described by proponents of the Garden Tomb as part of the tomb's sealing system and as the surrounding garden's source of water, respectively, have both been archaeologically dated to the Crusader period (12th-13th century).[2] The organisation maintaining the Garden Tomb refrains from claiming that this is the authentic tomb of Jesus, while pointing out the similarities with the site described in the Bible, and the fact that the Garden Tomb better preserves its ancient outlook than the more traditional, but architecturally altered and time-damaged tomb from the mostly crowded <link wikipedia="Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre" osm="612045225" type="way">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</link>; for all of these reasons, they suggest that the Garden Tomb is more evocative of the events described in the Gospels.[3]

It was first established at Hatherop in 1222 by William Longspee, Earl of Salisbury. The monks disliked the location, and on Longspee's death in 1226 they petitioned his countess for a new site to achieve greater solitude. She gave them her manors of Hinton Charterhouse and Norton St Philip and the new house was consecrated at Hinton Charterhouse in May 1232. A licence to sell alcohol at The George is claimed from 1397, which may have been a local licence from the Prior of Hinton Priory as Governmental licences for alehouses were only introduced in 1552.[5]

</p>
      <p id="GL573_306_002" num_links="3">The school was founded two years after the death of William Dummer, who funded it in his will. Dummer had been lieutenant governor and acting governor of Massachusetts for many years, and led the colony through a difficult period in the earlier 18th century: fighting off forays by French and Indians during what became known as Dummer's War in the 1720s. He also served as an early overseer of Harvard College. He was from a prominent colonial family with his brother Jeremiah Dummer having been a principal founding benefactor of the College of New Haven which later became <link wikipedia="Yale_University" osm="3861723" type="relation">Yale University</link>. As the <link wikipedia="Boston_Latin_School" osm="228877766" type="way">Boston Latin School</link> only accepted students from the city of Boston, the need arose for schools in more outlying areas to prepare students for college—the only ones existing at that time in New England being Harvard and Yale; Brown and <link wikipedia="Dartmouth_College" osm="251899405" type="node">Dartmouth</link> were founded a few years afterward. In that context, the Dummer Charity School or Dummer Grammar School commenced operation in 1763 pursuant to the will of Governor Dummer with Samuel Moody as its first headmaster. In 1782, the Dummer school was officially incorporated as the Dummer Academy,[5] whose graduates in this era comprised approximately 25% of the undergraduate student body at Harvard.  Most children in this era were home-schooled with pre-college education ending around the age of 14, with youths thereafter going on to college or entering the workforce. Thus most college freshmen tended to be the age of high school freshmen today.

The church is approached by twenty-nine steps; early travelers to Cairo dubbed it "the Staircase Church".[1] The land surface has risen by some six metres since the Roman period[why?] so the Roman tower is mostly buried below ground, reducing the visual impact of the church's elevated position. The entrance from the street is through iron gates under a pointed stone arch. The nineteenth-century facade with twin bell towers is then seen beyond a narrow courtyard decorated with modern art biblical designs. Up the steps and through the entrance is a further small courtyard leading to the eleventh-century outer porch.

Construction began in 1794 [2] and the local author and artist Fred Hando records that the building "was completed within two years".[3] The building was sited to take advantage of the views and the Monmouth antiquarian and publisher Charles Heath recorded in his 1807 history; Descriptive Account of the Kymin Pavilion and Beaulieu Grove with their various views; also a description of the Naval Temple that ten counties could be seen from the Roundhouse; (<link wikipedia="Gloucestershire" osm="85103 2700308" type="relation relation">Gloucestershire</link>, <link wikipedia="Monmouthshire" osm="358021" type="relation">Monmouthshire</link>, Glamorganshire, Breconshire, Montgomeryshire, <link wikipedia="Worcestershire" osm="57581" type="relation">Worcestershire</link>, <link wikipedia="Herefordshire" osm="10187" type="relation">Herefordshire</link>, Radnorshire, <link wikipedia="Shropshire" osm="57511" type="relation">Shropshire</link> and <link wikipedia="Somerset" osm="3125930" type="relation">Somerset</link>).[1] A telescope by Peter Dollond was fitted in the upper room and Heath detailed a large number of the sights that could be viewed from the five windows.[4].
