It is the oldest house in Washington (although not originally built there) and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1969.  The house was built in <link wikipedia="Danvers,_Massachusetts" osm="158811965 2355159" type="node relation">Danvers, Massachusetts</link> in 1754 as a grand summer home for Robert "King" Hooper, a leading shipowner and merchant in Marblehead, Massachusetts, who sided with the Tories before the Revolutionary War, and lent the house for four months to Thomas Gage, the reviled British Governor.  Hooper lost the house to creditors. After passing through several other owners, including one who used it as a boardinghouse, it was bought in 1860 by Francis Peabody Jr., who restored and added to it. It was bought in 1933 by antiques dealers Israel Sack and Leon David, who sold the paneled drawing room to a Kansas City museum.  The remainder of the house was sold for about $13,000 to George and Miriam Morris, who were seeking a period house to showcase their collection of early American furniture.  The Morrises had the house  dismantled and shipped to Washington, with the pieces numbered, in six railroad boxcars.  Under the direction of the key architect at <link wikipedia="Colonial_Williamsburg" osm="48916483" type="way">Colonial Williamsburg</link>, it was slowly reassembled from 1935-1938 on a concrete foundation, supported by steel beams.  Over the next 45 years, some 50,000 visitors passed through the house, greeted by the owners in period costume. In 1983 it was sold to Norman and Diane Bernstein, who modernized and updated the kitchen and plumbing. At that time, some of the furnishings were auctioned for $2.3 million at Christie's. In 2007 it was resold for $7.2 million, and in 2016 the house was listed for sale again.  The house measures 8,250 square feet, with 11 fireplaces, and has near-12-foot ceilings, interior columns, stenciled floors, and wallpaper designed in Paris in the early 1800s. [2]

      <p id="GL574_009_001" num_links="2">The music about the church was written by Dr. William S. Pitts in 1857 following a coach ride that stopped in Bradford, Iowa.  The church is in a valley near the town, though the church was not actually built until several years later.  In the years since, the church has become known simply as "the Little Brown Church". When Pitts returned to the area with his wife in 1862 he discovered a church being erected where he imagined it. The congregation had been meeting in various temporary spaces until Rev. J.K. Nutting led the drive to create a permanent home for the congregation.  During this period, Pitts had been teaching singing at nearby Bradford Academy and taught his class to sing his song for the first time at the dedication of the church in 1864.[1][2][3] Pitts later sold the rights to the song for a nominal sum. After the church closed in 1888 due to economic downturn in the town, the Society For the Preservation of the Little Brown Church was founded. By 1914, services were again held in the building.  Shortly afterward, the small congregation experienced a revival that attracted new attention to it and to its song. Among those who found and loved the song at this time was the Weatherwax Quartet.  This group of traveling singers traveled throughout <link wikipedia="Canada" osm="424313760 1428125" type="node relation">Canada</link> and the <link wikipedia="United_States" osm="424317935 148838" type="node relation">United States</link> in the 1920s and '30s and used as their trademark song "The Church in the Wildwood." They would quite easily talk about the little church during their travels. As the song grew in popularity, coupled with the development of the U.S. Highway system in the mid-1920s, many visitors came to the newly reopened little church. Since then the church has become a popular tourist spot, and remains so today.  It attracts thousands of visitors every year to see or be married in the "little brown church in the vale." The church is currently a member of the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches.

Grant with an outside entrance and was where Toys "R" Us was. The mall was expanded substantially in the 1980s adding a long wing created from the closed R. H. White building, leading to a new JCPenney store. In 1992 Sage-Allen closed their store at the mall and was replaced by a Service Merchandise store. Around that time, Toys "R" Us built a store that was attached to Bradlees, but only had an exterior entrance. Market Basket is now located on an outlot.  In 1999, more changes came to the mall. Service Merchandise closed their store in 1999 and as a result, the long side wing leading to their old store emptied out. In 2000, the mall big-boxed the wing turning much of it into an <link wikipedia="Old_Navy" osm="39416708" type="way">Old Navy</link> store along with replacing Service Merchandise with a Circuit City store. After Bradlees departure in 2001, the mall was left with a large vacancy. The former Bradlees store was later demolished in 2002 and its former mall entrance was replaced with an outdoor entrance to the mall. In the same year, Filene's opened a large two-level store at the mall, one entrance down from the former Bradlees store.[3]

According to the 2011 UK census, Market Weighton parish had a population of 6,429,[1] an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 5,212.[2]
The 19th-century English lexicographer Sir William Smith proposed Market Weighton as the location of the still-undiscovered Roman camp of Delgovicia. Historically the town was listed in the Domesday Book as "Wicstun" and was granted its charter to become a market town in 1251. Notable architecture includes: a parish church, parts of which are Norman, the Londesborough Arms (an 18th-century coaching inn), a Wesleyan chapel, a Methodist chapel and a high street still recognisable from the 19th century. Other sights of interest include the <link wikipedia="Post_office" osm="363499122 4979832588 495969245" type="node node way">post office</link>, the duck pond and Station Farm. Market Weighton history includes William Bradley, the Yorkshire Giant who at the age of 20 was 7 ft 9 in (2.36 m) tall.
In May of each year local residents take to the streets of Market Weighton for the Giant Community Day (formerly Giant Bradley Day) festival in a celebration of the life and times of William Bradley.
Industry in the town is largely based on agriculture. The town is known geologically for having given its name to the Market Weighton Axis.

The Grants as co-directors reopened the school as a semester program, retaining the character and mission but allowing high school students from around the country to attend for one semester of their junior year.

The Octagon property originally included a number of outbuildings, including a smokehouse, laundry, stables, carriage house, slave quarters, and an ice house (the only surviving outbuilding). The Tayloes were involved in shipbuilding, horse breeding and racing, and owned several iron foundries—they were fairly diversified for a plantation family.

This practice soon became the norm, and the place grew in popularity. The next phase in the history of The Orchard began when the poet Rupert Brooke took up lodging in the house in 1909. A graduate student of great popularity in the university community at the time, Brooke soon attracted a great following at the place, among them Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, E.M.

Jakes had moved from West Virginia with 50 families, who formed the nucleus of the new congregation.[4]
To handle expansion, the church built a 191,000-square-foot (17,700 m2) sanctuary at a cost of $45 million, paying off the debt in four years.
The auditorium was completed in August 2000 and features cascade seating, a large stage, a choir loft that can seat 450 and a state-of-the-art audio-visual system.
The sanctuary seats about 7,600 people and is also used for non-church events such as graduations, concerts and corporate presentations.[4][5]

The building was erected on the former site of One Meridian Plaza which was seriously damaged by a deadly fire in 1991. One Meridian Plaza was demolished in 1999 and the property was sold by E/R Partners to the Arden Group the next year. Development of the site by the Arden Group, which owns the adjacent <link wikipedia="Ritz-Carlton_Philadelphia" osm="333204594" type="way">Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia</link>, was delayed for years as a result of a feud with rival developer Mariner Commercial Properties. Mariner owned the property 1441 Chestnut Street, which sits south of the Residences at The Ritz-Carlton site and intends to build its own residential tower. The feud began after Arden Group's lead partner Craig Spencer blocked approval of 1441 Chestnut Street because he felt the tower's design would be detrimental to the planned Residences at The Ritz-Carlton tower. This led to several years of dispute between the developers trying to block construction of each other's towers.

"Uncloudy Day" was an early influence on Bob Dylan, who said of it in 2015, "It was the most mysterious thing I'd ever heard...

      <p id="GL574_473_002" num_links="2">The Thinker was initially named The Poet (French: Le Poète), and was part of a large commission begun in 1880 for a doorway surround called <link wikipedia="The_Gates_of_Hell" osm="5758204515" type="node">The Gates of Hell</link>.  Rodin based this on The Divine Comedy of <link wikipedia="Dante_Alighieri" osm="4622803513" type="node">Dante Alighieri</link>, and most of the figures in the work represented the main characters in the poem with The Thinker at the center of the composition over the doorway and somewhat larger than most of the other figures. Some critics believe that it was originally intended to depict Dante at the gates of Hell, pondering his great poem. Other critics reject that theory, pointing out that the figure is naked while Dante is fully clothed throughout his poem, and that the sculpture's physique does not correspond to Dante's effete figure.[1]  The sculpture is nude, as Rodin wanted a heroic figure in the tradition of Michelangelo, to represent intellect as well as poetry.[citation needed]

The modern version of the Tequila Sunrise cocktail was invented by Trident bartenders Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice in the early 1970s. In 1972, at a private party at the Trident organized by Bill Graham to kick off the Rolling Stones' 1972 tour in America, Mick Jagger had one of the cocktails, liked it, and he and his entourage started drinking them.[2] They later ordered them all across America, even dubbing the tour itself their "cocaine and tequila sunrise tour".[3][4]
