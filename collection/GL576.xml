</p>
      <p id="GL576_103_002" num_links="2">Thomasville was founded in 1888 and incorporated on November 24 of that year.[8]  The former community of Choctaw Corner, dating back to the antebellum period, was a settlement west of what would become Thomasville, but when the merchants there learned that a railroad was going to bypass their town to the east, they decided to move their stores to be near the railroad.[9] The former community is now inside the city limits.

First referred to as "Choctaw", the town was named after railroad financier and former Union Civil War general, Samuel Thomas, after he donated $500 for the construction of Thomasville's first school.[5] The town had expanded by the end of the 19th century with numerous stores, several hotels and boarding houses, and a depot station.[5]  In 1899, what is now downtown was destroyed by a fire that burned several blocks of the wood frame buildings. Thomasville quickly rebuilt, this time in brick, and was once again flourishing by the start of World War I.[9]

The Southern Railway eventually gave the structure to the town. The Thomasville Historical Society raised $5,000 for its restoration in 1969.[2] Another restoration was completed in the late 1990s.

According to a legend, seven Franciscan friars were beheaded on top of this hill. Wooden crosses were built in the location since the early 17th century. It soon became a symbol of the city and an integral part of the city's skyline. As wood rots, the crosses needed to be periodically replaced. In 1916, a concrete monument was designed by Polish–Lithuanian architect and sculptor Antoni Wiwulski or Antanas Vivulskis in Lithuanian. It was torn down in 1950 by order of the Soviet authorities. A new monument designed by Henrikas Šilgalis was erected in its place in 1989. The monument was depicted on 50 litas banknote.

It could be an embellishment of a story from Chronica XXIV Generalium about two Franciscans murdered around 1340.[2] It could also be an embellishment of a story from De Conformitate Vitae B. P. Francisco by Bartholomew Rinonico about five Franciscans martyrs. If the latter is the case, the event most likely occurred in 1369.[3]

As per the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) report, the accident resulted in no deaths or injuries to plant workers or members of nearby communities.[4] Follow-up epidemiology studies have linked no incidents of cancer to the accident.[5][6][7][8]
The reactor core of TMI-2 has since been removed from the site, but the site has not been decommissioned.[9] In July 1998, Amergen Energy (now Exelon Generation) agreed to purchase TMI-1 from General Public Utilities for $100 million.[10]

Robles, who born in 1857, in Baviácora, Sonora, Mexico. His family relocated to Tucson in 1864, where he grew up. After spending sometime in <link wikipedia="Florence,_Arizona" osm="150943573 110778" type="node relation">Florence, Arizona</link>, he returned to Tucson and accepted a mail route to Gunsight, Arizona, near <link wikipedia="Ajo,_Arizona" osm="150963593 33021426" type="node way">Ajo</link>. It was during this time he located what is now called Robles Pass, near Cat (Back) Mountain, while searching for a shorter route to Gunsight. In 1882, he had his brother Jesús homesteaded 160 acres at what is now Robles Junction/Three Points. The brothers dug a well to set up a watering stop and stage station so Bernabe could water his horses along his mail route. He eventually gave up his mail route, and moved to the former watering stop/stage station, which at that point was called the Robles Ranch. He and his family ran the ranch for many years, even after the family had moved back to Tucson. Robles died in 1945. The old ranch house is now the Three Points/Robles Junction Community Center.[3]
