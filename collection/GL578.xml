It acquired its name after the building of its cemetery church, consecrated to the icon of the Tikhvin Mother of God. It soon superseded the Lazarevskoe Cemetery and became a popular and prestigious burial ground. The first literary figure, Nikolay Karamzin, was buried in the cemetery in 1826, followed in 1833 by Nikolay Gnedich, an associate of <link wikipedia="Alexander_Pushkin" osm="1166762866 1704081725 2193982709 3862494053" type="node node node node">Alexander Pushkin</link>'s.

Several years after being added to the district, The Chicago Board of Education decided that a new building was need for the school; approving a 7–million dollar budget for construction of the new school in 1901. The new school, located on South Union Avenue and West 47th Place, was designed by Dwight H. Perkins[4] and constructed between March 1904 to August 1905. In 1915, the school was re–named Edward Tilden High School, honoring the recently deceased banker and former president of the Chicago Board of Education. In 1919, the school board decided that Tilden would no longer serve as a regular high school and would become an all–boys "technical" high school, forcing students who didn't want a technical education to transfer to other schools such as Lindblom and Englewood high schools.[5] In 1960, the school was changed into a co–educational neighborhood high school.

Over the years, storms have damaged the lighthouse, shattered the lens, and eroded the rock. It was decommissioned in 1957, and has since been sold to private owners.

The village or hamlet comprises around 20 dwellings and of these up to 10 are designated listed buildings including Tilley Manor, Tilley Farm and Brook Cottage; all three are timber-framed and have their origins in the Medieval and early Post Medieval periods; Tilley Farm and Manor are of the classic cross-wing vernacular and clearly very early in date, probably 13th/14th century.  Despite the wealth of medieval and post-medieval timber-framed buildings, Tilley does not possess a church. However, it is probable that such a building may have existed somewhere within the centre of the village, probably close to the <link wikipedia="Manor_house" osm="681158254" type="way">manor house</link>.  The hamlet appears to be divided into two clusters; the main settlement centred on the medieval buildings and to the east, a peripheral area lying close to the railway which comprise buildings that date from the 18th and 19th centuries.

The airport currently has no scheduled airline operations, with just one operator offering regular charter services.  The relatively small size of aircraft able to take off and land at Tioman means that per seat costs are relatively high making it hard for airlines operating out of the island to remain profitable.[2] The airport's runway is "one way" as planes can only land from and take off in one direction (north) due to nearby terrain.

Its summit is 6,668 metres (21,877 ft) above sea level and the complex covers a surface area of 25 square kilometres (9.7 sq mi). There are reports of fumarolic activity, and de Silva and Francis (1991) considered that the volcano was last active in the Holocene.[1] The Tipas-Cerro Bayo complex was active 2.9-1.2 million years ago with dacites and rhyolites. Magma composition is typical for Andean stratovolcanoes. Tomographic studies of the underlying crust indicate a pattern of seismic attenuation beneath Tipas.[2]
