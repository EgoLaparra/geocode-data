The town was established in 1550 on what was originally an island in the Papaloapan River. From the colonial era to the 20th century, it was an important port, one of few interior river ports in Latin America. However, with the construction of the railroad, Tlacotalpan's importance faded. Starting in the latter 20th century, efforts to conserve the town's Spanish/Caribbean architecture and layout began, culminating in World Heritage status. Today, its main economic support is fishing and tourism, especially to the annual feast in honor of Our Lady of Candlemas.

      <p id="GL579_388_002" num_links="4">In 1580, a group of Yermak Timofeyevich's Cossacks initiated the Russian conquest of Siberia, pushing eastwards on behalf of the Tsardom of Russia. They attacked the Vogul (Mansi) and Ostyak (Khanty) peoples in Yugra, and had also captured a tax collector of Kuchum Khan, the king of the large Tatar Khanate of Sibir, the most powerful force in the western <link wikipedia="Siberia" osm="5332639323" type="node">Siberia</link> region on the eastern side of the <link wikipedia="Ural_Mountains" osm="3446716015" type="node">Ural Mountains</link>. At the time the Voguls and Ostyaks were subjects of Kuchum, and in response retaliation attacks were carried out against the Cossacks by the Tatars. After a year of Tatar attacks, Yermak prepared for the conquest of the Khanate of Sibir and a campaign to take the Khanate's capital city, Qashliq. The Cossacks conquered the city on 26 October 1582, sending Kuchum into retreat. Despite the conquest, Kuchum had regrouped his remaining forces and formed a new army, launching a surprise attack on 6 August 1584, killing Yermak. This resulted in a series of battles over Qashliq, passing between Tatar and Cossack control, with the city being abandoned in 1588. Kuchum was eventually defeated by the Cossacks in 1598 at the Battle of Urmin near the <link wikipedia="Ob_River" osm="2469254" type="relation">River Ob</link>, ending the Khanate of Sibir, and establishing Russian control over the western <link wikipedia="Siberia" osm="5332639323" type="node">Siberia</link> region.
