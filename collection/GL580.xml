Originally concerned only with the Maori that originally lived and owned the land of new Zealand, initially just those who arrived between 1848 and the first of the Otago gold rushes in 1861, the institution gradually enlarged its scope to include later arrivals. At that point the word 'early' was dropped from the name of the Museum and the Association. Its collections evolved reflecting these changes but remain focused on the historical period, i.e. since James Cook's first visit to southern New Zealand in 1770.

It is over Tom Gate, on St Aldates, the main entrance of Christ Church, Oxford, which leads into Tom Quad. This square tower with an octagonal lantern and facetted ogee dome was designed by Christopher Wren and built 1681–82. The strength of Oxford architectural tradition and Christ Church's connection to its founder, Henry VIII, motivated the decision to complete the gatehouse structure, left unfinished by Cardinal Wolsey at the date of his fall from power in 1529, and which had remained roofless since. Wren made a case for working in a Late Gothic style—that it "ought to be Gothick to agree with the Founders worke"[1]—a style that had not been seen in a prominent building for a hundred and fifty years, making Tom Tower a lonely precursor[2] of the Gothic Revival that got underway in the mid-18th century.[3] Wren never came to supervise the structure as it was being erected by the stonemason he had recommended, Christopher Kempster of <link wikipedia="Burford" osm="14336562" type="node">Burford</link>.[4]

The initial ktitors were Toma Cozma and his wife Ecaterina; he was a local boyar who steadily rose through the ranks: șetrar, medelnicer, paharnic and ban.[1] It has been suggested that he was of Roma origin.[2] The church he built was small and simple in form, without spires.[1] It was made a metochion of <link wikipedia="Iviron" osm="303639442" type="node">Iviron</link> on <link wikipedia="Mount_Athos" osm="2135921" type="relation">Mount Athos</link>, and was known as the church of the potters' guild.[2] The next ktitorissa, Maria Anastasiu Apostol Ketreanca, added a bell tower during an 1847 reparation, as attested on a plaque on the western wall.[1] It is this inscription that notes the 1807 construction date. However, the icon of Saint Thomas, to the right of the entrance, shows the ktitor as a paharnic, indicating a date for the icon before 1806, when he was elevated to ban. As icons were ordered near the point of a church's completion, it is possible the building was finished around 1804. Maria also expanded the vestibule, built a space for vestments on the south facade and a surrounding wall.[2]

Its final location was to the present location in the Jangan Castle in the city center of Pyongyang.[1] Kogyuro had five ancient tribes each with its own ancestral tomb observing rites celebrated during the tenth month of every year by performing the tongmyong ("petition to the east") which is the worship of a heavenly deity named Susin.[3] Kiringul is situated 200 metres (660 ft) from the Yongmyong Temple in Moran Hill in Pyongyang City. It is a rectangular rock which is carved with the inscription “Unicorn Lair". Based on the discovery of the king's unicorn lair, archaeologists of the History Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences inferred that Pyongyang was the capital city of Ancient Korea and concurrently of the Koguryo Kingdom.[4] In 1697, during the era of Sukjong of Joseon, the king endorsed a proposal to annually repair the Tomb of King Tongmyong.[5]

Its population grew from 100 to around 14,000 in less than seven years. It is best known as the site of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and presently draws most of its revenue from tourism.

The town of Tombstone was incorporated in 1879. By 1881 the town had grown to more than 7,000 population; stage robberies were no longer novel events. But more important than the lawlessness, Tombstone miners and merchants had to travel 150 dusty roundtrip miles to Tucson to record mining claims, deeds, contracts, etc. at the Pima County Courthouse. At the time, the area was part of <link wikipedia="Pima_County,_Arizona" osm="1832206" type="relation">Pima County</link> with the county seat <link wikipedia="Tucson,_Arizona" osm="150964034 253824" type="node relation">Tucson</link> being a rugged two-day, 70-mile journey away. In 1881, as a result of these incentives, and aided by a shrewd agreement with the Prescott delegation to the Territorial Legislature, the residents of the thriving boomtown voted to separate from Pima County and the territorial legislature subsequently formed a new county, <link wikipedia="Cochise_County,_Arizona" osm="1832184" type="relation">Cochise County</link>.  Cochise county was formed in 1881 from the eastern part of Pima County, and Tombstone became its seat (The Territorial Capital stayed at Prescott rather than moving to Tucson).
