This is backed up by the presence of several areas of local shops, which served their respective villages in the past, and to an extent still do today. Until the 1967 forest perambulation fencing, New Forest ponies were free to roam its streets.

During the American Civil War, Toulminville was mapped along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad as a significant settlement, northwest of Mobile (see map).  In 1945, the remainder of Toulminville was annexed into the city of Mobile. The area of Toulminville has varied over the past decades from being an upper-middle class suburb to having a serious crime problem during most of the 1980s and 1990s, although the trend has been reversed in recent years.

In 589 the bishop, St. Heliodorus, transferred the see to Sion, as Octodurum was frequently endangered by the inundations of the Rhone and the Drance.  Very little is known about the early Bishops and the early churches in Sion.  However, in the late 10th century the last King of Upper <link wikipedia="Burgundy" osm="27768" type="relation">Burgundy</link> Rudolph III, granted the County of Valais to Bishop Hugo (998-1017).  The combination of spiritual and secular power made the Prince-Bishops the most powerful nobles in the Upper Rhone valley.  Sion became the political and religious center of the region.  By the 12th century they began building impressive churches and castles in Sion to represent their power and administer their estates.[2]  Valère, as the residence of the cathedral chapter in Sion, was one-third of the administrative center of the powerful Diocese of Sion. In the 12th century the Cathedral Notre Dame de Sion (du Glarier) was built in the town below Valère hill.[3]  Glarier Cathedral became the seat of the Diocese of Sion, while the Prince-Bishop of Sion lived in the castle.

      <p id="GL583_334_001" num_links="9">Towanda, Illinois, was named for Towanda in Bradford County, Pennsylvania.The name means "burial ground" in Nanticoke, an Algonquian language[3].The land on which Towanda stands was first entered by Charles Badeau who had graduated from <link wikipedia="Wesleyan_University" osm="9212411" type="relation">Wesleyan University</link>, <link wikipedia="Middletown,_Connecticut" osm="158817065 6580065" type="node relation">Middletown, Connecticut</link>, in 1840, and was employed as the assistant to the chief engineer of what was then the Alton and Springfield Railroad.[4] Because in Illinois at that time it was illegal for railroads or their officials to establish new towns, much of the land was then transferred to two McLean County real estate developers Jesse W. Fell (November 10, 1808 – February 22, 1887) and Charles W. Holder (September 29, 1819 - April 30, 1900). These two men laid out the town of Towanda and filed the plat on December 7, 1854.[5] Jesse W. Fell, a native of Chester County in southeastern Pennsylvania, was a widely known land dealer in Central Illinois who played major role in founding many Illinois towns including <link wikipedia="Clinton,_Illinois" osm="153795720 124779" type="node relation">Clinton</link>, <link wikipedia="Dwight,_Illinois" osm="153621717 125889" type="node relation">Dwight</link>, <link wikipedia="Normal,_Illinois" osm="59896445 126777" type="node relation">Normal</link>, <link wikipedia="Pontiac,_Illinois" osm="153407578 125876" type="node relation">Pontiac</link>, and who was the driving force behind the establishment of the school that would become Illinois State University [6] Holder was linked with Fell in many of his town founding schemes including Normal and Larchwood in <link wikipedia="Lyon_County,_Iowa" osm="1646301" type="relation">Lyon County</link>, <link wikipedia="Iowa" osm="316955537 161650" type="node relation">Iowa</link>; the McLean County town of <link wikipedia="Holder,_Illinois" osm="153384175" type="node">Holder</link> is named in his honor. Fell association with the railroad goes back to the time when it was surveyed. On at least two occasions he was able to alter the path of the railroad to suit his own interests: organizing a bend in the road so it would pass through his town of Normal[7] and making a slight change in the survey so it would pass through the Livingston County town of Pontiac, where he had interests rather than the rival town of Richmond.[8] Shortly after Towanda was laid out most of the land was back in the hands of the railroad's land agent English-born Charles Roadnight (1814-?). Roadnight built the first warehouse in Towanda; he settled in Bloomington, had a farm in Dwight, and in 1858 later became treasurer of what was then the Chicago and Alton Railroad.[9]

Tower Rock received its current name when Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition visited the site in 1805.

In 1869 a 1,340-foot (410 m) circular tunnel was dug through the London clay using a cast iron shield, an idea that had been patented in 1864 by Peter W. Barlow but never built.[1] A 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow gauge railway was laid in the tunnel and from August 1870 a cable-hauled wooden carriage conveyed passengers from one end to the other. This was uneconomic and the company went bankrupt by the end of the year. The tunnel was converted to pedestrian use and one million people a year crossed under the river, paying a toll of ​1⁄2d. The opening of the toll-free <link wikipedia="Tower_Bridge" osm="2079674503 378541210" type="node way">Tower Bridge</link> in 1894 caused a drop in income and the tunnel closed in 1898, after being sold to the London Hydraulic Power Company.

It is also known in Spanish as Calle Cuartel, in reference to the barracks constructed on the street in 1740. It is one of the three main parallel streets in the old town and is likely to date back to the Moorish period. Until the mid-19th century it was notorious for its filthiness due to wholly inadequate sanitation and lack of any running water supply. It was the point of outbreak of Gibraltar's devastating 1804 epidemic of yellow fever, which killed a third of the territory's population. The street is now a residential and commercial area notable for several important public buildings in addition to the old Georgian barracks, which have been converted for civilian use.

A spur line, the Nishi-Toyokawa Line, connected to the station on May 12, 1942. On August 1, 1943, the Toyokawa Railway was nationalized along with some other local lines to form the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) Iida Line.[2]  The Nishi-Toyokawa Line ceased operation in 1956. Scheduled freight operations were discontinued in 1984.  Along with its division and privatization of JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came under the control and operation of the Central Japan Railway Company.
