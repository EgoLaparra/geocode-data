As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.[5] Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) or above 80 °F (27 °C).[5] During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.[6] Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.[6]

      <p id="GL583_116_002" num_links="8">Souroti is an immigrant's village, one of the many that were established in Greek Macedonia after the Balkan wars and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Shortly before 1912 the area was called "Surukli" (from the Turkish suru which means herd) and was owned by five Turkish land owners (Τσιφλικάδες) who sold their land to Jews from Thessaloniki. The first Greeks that settled in the area were a vlach family from <link wikipedia="Vlasti" osm="1384400232" type="node">Vlasti</link> of the <link wikipedia="Kozani_(regional_unit)" osm="956726" type="relation">Kozani regional unit</link>, the Christos Lolas' family. Although they were originally shepherds, the family sold their sheep to buy the land from the Jews. In 1914 forty families of arvanites came from <link wikipedia="Mandritsa" osm="273874308" type="node">Mandritsa</link> (Μανδρίτσα) in North Thrace following a Bulgarian invasion in their home village. Most of them were bilingual in Greek and Arvanitika. Their primary occupation was sericulture and they moved to Souroti to take advantage of the local mulberries. At the same time they maintained trade bonds with Jewish silk producers in Thrace. In 1922, after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey about 48 families arrived from <link wikipedia="Anatolia" osm="4869487523" type="node">Asia Minor</link> originating from <link wikipedia="İzmir" osm="428039507" type="node">Izmir</link> (Σμύρνη), <link wikipedia="Aydın" osm="25869583" type="node">Aydin</link> (Αϊδίνιο), Cius (Κίος), <link wikipedia="Mudanya" osm="248521661" type="node">Mudanya</link> (Μουδανιά) and also from Eastern Thrace. Those were educated and they carried their own traditions. In Souroti they worked in sericulture, olive oil production and vine dressing. Between 1928 and 1930 more vlach shepherds came from <link wikipedia="Vlasti" osm="1384400232" type="node">Vlasti</link> along with 4-5 families of Sarakatsanoi (Σαρακατσάνοι). Land was distributed to the immigrants by the Greek state first in 1914 and later in 1932.

Construction was protracted due to the failure of the original contractors to secure proper bonds, and the light was not brought into service until 1897. It is an atypical structure for its era, a large ​2 1⁄2-story brick Queen Anne house with a 3-story tower built into one corner. It was fitted with a fourth order Fresnel lens, originally lit by oil, but eventually converted to electricity.[4][5]

This included constructing the current station building at Meade and Washington and selling the old downtown station, which had opened in 1921. When Amtrak took over intercity rail service in 1971, it used this station instead of the larger Union Station.[3][4][5] The South Shore Line moved its terminus to a <link wikipedia="South_Bend_Airport_station" osm="1268318822" type="node">new terminal</link> at the <link wikipedia="South_Bend_International_Airport" osm="224696857" type="way">South Bend International Airport</link> in November 1992, although the track that used to terminate here was retained.[6]

      <p id="GL583_252_002" num_links="4">In the 1960s, the Port Authority began phasing out streetcar lines and replacing them with buses. The creation of a rail rapid transit system was also discussed, and one of the target routes was a corridor bordering Route 51 through the <link wikipedia="Brookline_(Pittsburgh)" osm="6897587" type="relation">Brookline</link> and <link wikipedia="Overbrook_(Pittsburgh)" osm="6897586" type="relation">Overbrook</link> neighborhoods. While light rail would be developed during the following decade, the Port Authority decided to use the corridor to allows buses to avoid the crowded, narrow, and stop light-filled Route 51. In 1977, a two-lane route was constructed in a valley close to the road. Unlike later American busways, including the city's <link wikipedia="Martin_Luther_King_Jr._East_Busway" osm="4051383" type="relation">Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway</link> (opened in 1983) and <link wikipedia="West_Busway" osm="4051402" type="relation">West Busway</link> (opened in 2000), the route was not designed as a route in itself and does not feature the amenities associated with modern BRTs, such as branded buses, special stations, or other rail-like features. Instead, standard bus shelters are included and no routes terminate at the end of the busway. The main goal of the road is to allow for suburban buses to operate more quickly and to encourage the use of public transportation by allowing riders to avoid a highly congested highway.  Following the naming convention of each busway being designated by a color, bus routes that use the South Busway begin with a "Y" for yellow.

An 1828 treaty with the Cherokee Nation assigned the area of Nowata County to the Cherokees, who included it in 1856 in their newly created Cooweescoowee District.

In 1993 the Overbrook (Blue) Line was shut down for complete reconstruction to serve the modern-day light rail cars.[3]  During construction, it was found that a segment of track between the Boggs Ave. stop and South Hills Junction was too narrow for the larger vehicles; this was bypassed with two wide-curved rail ramps built between the Beechview (Red) Line's Palm Garden stop and South Hills Junction where the two branches now merge.
