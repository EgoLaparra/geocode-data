It was a purely agricultural settlement but added tanning as a secondary industry during medieval times, using the bark of the oak and birch, both plentiful in the area. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the main industries were framework knitting and mining. The knitters, or shiners as they were known from the state of their trouser seats after a 14-hour day sitting at their machines, tended to live in certain areas, around the Dog Pool, along Water Lane and particularly up the narrow alleys around the Old Market place.

A 1996 report described the infrastructure of the Zone as "weak and for the most part non-existent; this is a disadvantage inherited from historical neglect of a typical marginal region." It also observed that the Debub Omo Zone "one of Ethiopian's socially most diverse zones. It contains a minimum of 12 different ethnic groups, and possibly as many as 21. Social diversity therefore compounds the existing problems of isolation, acute shortage of basic infrastructure as well as scarcity of professional and technical man-power."[1]

Towards the end of the Industrial Revolution, the area saw rapid growth in population and urban development.

He was impressed by the park and its design within an urban environment. Despite South Salt Lake being rural at the time, he decided to name the area Central Park. In 1925 the <link wikipedia="The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" osm="4593317367 81369707 481406554" type="node way way">LDS</link> Central Park Ward was created and named after the development.   In 1936, an attempted annexation by Salt Lake City failed due to concerns over funding and implementation of a sewer system. On August 14, 1936 a resolution creating the Town of Central Park was approved by the Board of County Commissioners - however, this did last long, as voters then decided to disincorporate the town in 1937. In a close vote, voters then approved incorporation of South Salt Lake. On September 29, 1938, still in need of a sewer system, South Salt Lake voted to incorporate as the Town of South Salt Lake, with Robert R. Fitts as the first town president. The town was also lacking many other basic amenities at the time that would be easier to implement with incorporation, such as a post office and fire department. In 1939, the Works Progress Administration finally began construction of a sewer system, with a cost of $462,000. The original boundary of South Salt Lake was from 500 East to 300 West and 2100 South to Mill Creek on the south. On August 1, 1950 the population had increased enough for South Salt Lake to be designated as a third class city. This changed the form of government to a mayor and city council. The town president of the time, Marlow Callahan, became the first mayor of the City of South Salt Lake.[3] In the 1990s, South Salt Lake annexed portions of an unincorporated portion of Salt Lake County to the south, and nearly doubled in land area and population.

The Malays is the dominant ethnic group in the province. Most of them spoke the Palembang Malay, which is mutually unintelligible to both Indonesian and Standard Malay. Other ethnic groups also inhabits the province, such as the Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau and Chinese. Most of them are concentrated around urban areas, as they are mostly immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.

      <p id="GL584_267_002" num_links="10">The province was once the seat of many great kingdoms and empires. From the 7th century to the late 14th century, the province was the seat of the Buddhist Srivijaya Empire, which influenced much of Southeast Asia.[6] Srivijaya was an important centre for the expansion of Buddhism from the 8th to the 12th century. Srivijaya was the first unified kingdom to dominate much of Indonesian archipelago.[7] Owing to its geographical position, the capital of Srivijaya, <link wikipedia="Palembang" osm="2081450443" type="node">Palembang</link>, becomes one of the most thriving port in the region. The city was frequented by many traders from the <link wikipedia="Middle_East" osm="414980155 415145069" type="node node">Middle-East</link>, the <link wikipedia="Indian_subcontinent" osm="5839621119" type="node">Indian Subcountinent</link> and <link wikipedia="China" osm="424313582 270056" type="node relation">China</link>.

After Srivijaya collapsed in the 14th century, small kingdoms began to establish itself in the province. Beginning in the 16th century, Islam began to spread in the region, effectively replacing Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion in the region. In the 17th century, the Islamic Palembang Sultanate was established with Palembang as its capital. At that time, however, Europeans began arriving in the region, first the Portuguese and then the Dutch. The Dutch became the dominant power in the region. Through the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the Dutch exerted influence on the Palembang Sultanate. In 1811, during the Napoleonic Wars, the last Sultan of Palembang, Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II attacked the Dutch in Palembang, but he refused to cooperate with the British, so Thomas Stamford Raffles sent troops to attack Palembang and Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II was forced to flee the royal palace, then Raffles appointed the Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin II, brother of Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II as king. In 1813 Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II again took over the kingdom, but one month later he was brought down again by Raffles and reappointed Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin II, causing a split in the Sultanate of Palembang.[8] After the Dutch returned to the region, the Dutch attacked and annexed the sultanate to the Dutch East Indies, and exiled the sultan and his family to <link wikipedia="Ternate" osm="545807270" type="node">Ternate</link>. The Dutch controlled the region for the next century, but during <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>, the Japanese attacked Palembang and expelled the Dutch. The Japanese occupied the region until August 1945, when they surrendered to the Allied forces. The Dutch attempted to return to the region, but this was opposed by the newly-declared <link wikipedia="Indonesia" osm="6677037562 304751" type="node relation">Republic Of Indonesia</link>, resulting in a war of independence. In the end, the Dutch recognize the Indonesian sovereignty and withdrew from the region in 1950. The province of South Sumatra was formed in 12 September 1950.

By the late 12th century the royal castle had been largely converted to stone, playing an important part in the wine trade conducted through the Southampton docks. By the end of the 13th century the castle was in decline, but the threat of French raids in the 1370s led Richard II to undertake extensive rebuilding. The result was a powerfully defended castle, one of the first in England to be equipped with <link wikipedia="Cannon" osm="243045721" type="node">cannon</link>. The castle declined again in the 16th century and was sold off to property speculators in 1618.

It is a tapering, multi-tiered pylon which culminates in a series of diminishing layers before terminating in a sarcophagus (or cenotaph, "empty tomb") which features a recumbent figure of a soldier. In front is an altar-like Stone of Remembrance. The cenotaph contains multiple sculptural details including a prominent cross, the town's coat of arms, and two lions. The names of the dead are inscribed on three sides. Although similar in outline, Lutyens' later cenotaphs were much more austere and featured almost no sculpture. The design uses abstract, ecumenical features and lifts the recumbent soldier high above eye level, anonymising him.

In this case, it should have belonged to one of the many pharaohs who ruled between the beginning of the 13th Dynasty and the loss of control of the northern territory occurred during or soon after the reign of Merneferre Ay.[3]
