This approximately 1000 kilometer long, 90–230 km broad structure is an east-west, active, continental volcanic arc; encompassing an area of approximately 160,000 km2.[1] Over several million years, the subduction of the Rivera and Cocos plates beneath the North American Plate along the northern end of the Middle America Trench formed the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.[6][7] 
The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is a unique volcanic belt; it is not parallel to the Middle American Trench, and many of the main stratovolcanoes are positioned obliquely to the general position of the arc. In addition to the physiographic complexities, igneous compositions vary—dominant subduction related products contrast with intraplate geo-chemical signatures.[1][3] The many intriguing aspects of the belt has spurred several hypotheses based on a typical subduction scenario; Intra-plate leaky transform faults, mantle plumes, continental rifting, and jump of the eastward Pacific Rise.[1][6] These features are partially related to the reactivation of early fault systems during the Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt's evolution. The main brittle fault system's geometry, kinematics, and age define a complex array of what could be multiple factors affecting the deformation of the belt.[1][2][8] It exhibits many volcanic features, not limited to large stratovolcanoes, including monogenetic volcano cones, shield volcanoes, lava dome complexes, and major calderas.[3]

      <p id="GL584_244_002" num_links="2">The Transfiguration Church is situated next to military cemetery that was established in 17th-20th centuries. The second name of the church ― Ratnaya, is linked to Ratny tract, which had long been a place of Cossack armies' assemble. According to historical sources it is known that in 1673 in the hills just north to Cherkassk there was built a town with a population of about 6,000 people. The reason for establishment of the settlement was the alliance of Don Cossacks and Russia in their fight against the Turks in <link wikipedia="Azov" osm="283030477" type="node">Azov</link>. Ratnaya Church, dedicated to St. Elijah was built in 1701. The completion is specified in a petition of the Don Cossacks to Tsar <link wikipedia="Peter_the_Great" osm="6204100696" type="node">Peter I</link>, in which the Cossacks requested some priests to be sent. Local archives point out that the church was made of wood as of 1718. Since 1735 the church is marked in Cherkassk maps. By decree of Elizabeth I on May 31, 1744 in Cherkassk began the construction of a stone church. The bell tower was built in 1751. During the construction there was brought 3276 kg of copper and tin for the production of bells. The church according to some sources, burnt down on August 12, 1744. In 1748 was another fire, and by 1781 the church was restored.[1]

The subsequent owner, Augsburg knight Georg von Ilsung finished the north wing and also the inner yards striking façade painting originate from this era. He and his family owned the castle for the second half of the 16th century and added the castles name to their family name. Georg von Ilsungs Daughter married Jakob III. Fugger. The wealthy Augsburg merchant family Fugger were also deeply involved in the local copper and silver mining businesses and inherited the castle in 1589.

It was first mentioned in written documents dating to 1526 and was one of the oldest churches in the Parish of Osilnica. Some sources indicate that defensive walls stood around the church to protect against Ottoman raids; no trace of these walls remain today. The church stood in the middle of the village cemetery; it had a rectangular nave and an octagonal chancel walled on three sides. A square belfry stood on the north side of the building and the sacristy stood on the south side between the nave and chancel. The present-day ruins date from a rebuilding of the church in the 17th century. The church was assigned to the newly founded Parish of Draga in 1834. The building was reworked at the end of the 19th century with the addition of the belfry, the sacristy, and new windows; the interior was also newly vaulted at this time, and the year 1894 was carved into the stone door casing. The church was covered by a gabled shingled roof. The church was burned down by the Partisans on 22 July 1942. It was not rebuilt after the war; the ruins include the partially preserved tower of the belfry.[5][6][7]

During its early years, TraveLodge emphasized itself as a budget motel chain that offered functional accommodations at rates lower than other chains. TraveLodge also emphasized that its motels were centrally located in or near downtown areas in order to be convenient to local restaurants, churches, theatres, shopping areas and tourist attractions. Today, however, there are many different hotel "tiers" that Travelodge offers, from budget-priced properties to full-service high-rise hotels. Travelodge purchased the Skylight Inn of America Inn in 1987, which was founded only five years prior in <link wikipedia="Cleveland" osm="18948478 182130" type="node relation">Cleveland, Ohio</link>,[2] and Lodge Keeper Group, which operated LK and Country Hearth, in 1990.[3][4]

Mentioned by Pausanias, it was still visible in 1879 when the German archeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered the shaft graves under the 'agora' in the Acropolis at Mycenae.  The tomb has probably no relationship with either Atreus or Agamemnon, as archaeologists believe that the sovereign buried there ruled at an earlier date than the two; it was named thus by Heinrich Schliemann and the name has been used ever since.[citation needed]

      <p id="GL584_486_001" num_links="3">The church was founded to serve the new affluent development of Tredegarville, which has since been absorbed by Roath. It was formed as an offshoot of Bethany chapel, which was then located in Cardiff City Centre (though would move to suburban premises in Rhiwbina in the 1950s). The minister of Bethany, Alfred Tilly, together with 111 of his parishioners, left to found the new cause. They began in rooms in City Road in 1860. Work commenced the following year on a permanent place of worship. The site was donated by Lord Tredegar himself, who is said to have insisted that the church be cruciform in design. A schoolroom was opened on 3 December 1861, with the chapel itself following in 1862. The limestone used to build the church was once believed to have come from Italy, but is more likely to have hailed from <link wikipedia="Galway" osm="582043319 1390623" type="node relation">Galway</link> as ballast in coal ships. In its earlier years, the church had two small pinnacles on its roof, but these have since been removed. In addition to the gift of the and from Lord Tredegar, the church was generously supported by the wealthy Cory family. Of an evangelical bent, it founded several missions elsewhere in Cardiff and also engaged in missionary work abroad. <link wikipedia="William_Booth" osm="5610431350" type="node">William Booth</link>, the founder of the <link wikipedia="The_Salvation_Army" osm="2348014592 3328752233 5423523504 716036339" type="node node node way">Salvation Army</link> gave his first worship service in Cardiff at the church in 1863 because of Tredegarville's huge effort in establishing the cause. The missionary to China Timothy Richards was also very grateful to Tredegarville for its financial support in his ministry. Tredegarville's missionary to the Congo Henry Richards is also recognised today as one of the greatest Baptist missionaries of America when it adopted the David Livingstone mission as its own. [1]
