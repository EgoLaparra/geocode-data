The plans for Southridge High School were originally designed for a high school on the east side of the country; however, the school was never built and the Kennewick School District purchased the blueprints and plans. During construction, classes were held at Fruitland Elementary School, under the direction of Principal Ron Williamson.[2] The first commencement was held inside the <link wikipedia="Toyota_Center_(Kennewick,_Washington)" osm="35692930" type="way">Toyota Center</link> in June 1999.[3] Southridge was the third 4A school constructed in Kennewick, but with the reorganization of leagues in 2006, Southridge became a 3A school and is now a member of the Columbia Basin League.[4] Yet again, in 2008, it was decided that Southridge would be put back under the 4A schools along with 2 other high schools in Kennewick, WA.  Once again in 2010 Southridge was brought back down to a 3A school.

A door 27 feet (8.2 m) high provides access for bringing equipment into the chamber, which is equipped with several viewports through which remote viewing apparatus can observe the test.  The chamber has a cooling wall capable of being maintained at −320 °F (−195.6 °C), cooled by liquid nitrogen.  Infrared lamps simulate radiation environments found in space, and the chamber is capable of being having its pressure reduced to the equivalent of 100 miles (160 km) of altitude.[3]  Engines in the test chamber can generate a thrust up to 400,000 pounds.

The wall was built by Spanish administrators of Pohnpei in 1887 after a local uprising drove the local Spanish authorities onto a ship in the harbor. Most of the wall was taken down by the German administration that took over in the early 20th century, after the Spanish–American War.

In response, Spain severed diplomatic relations on April 21. The same day, the United States Navy began a blockade of Cuba. Spain declared war on April 23. On April 25, Congress declared that a state of war between the U.S. and Spain had existed since April 21.[1]
