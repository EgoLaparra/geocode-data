It is the oldest church in Germany and the largest religious structure in Trier, notable for its long life span and grand design. The central part of the nave was built of Roman brick in the early fourth century, resulting in a cathedral that was added onto gradually in different eras. The imposing Romanesque westwork, with four towers and an additional apse, has been copied repeatedly.[3] The Trier Cathedral Treasury contains an important collection of Christian art. In 1986 the church was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as part of the Roman Monuments, Cathedral of St. Peter and Church of Our Lady in Trier.

In 2008, the school's name was changed to the current Trine University, in honor of alumnus Dr. Ralph Trine and his wife Sheri. The dropping of the "Tri-State" identifier reflected a desire to brand the school as a nationally competitive private university, not to be confused as being <link wikipedia="Public_university" osm="90337" type="relation">state-funded</link>, or as being associated with businesses or organizations nationwide also using the prevalent "Tri-State" tag.

The original plans called for a complex of buildings that included a church, diocesan offices, a library, and a Bishop's residence.

While not completed, the first services were held the following year.  Except for the spire, the church building was completed in 1894.  It was consecrated on May 25 of that year and was put into service as the diocesan cathedral.[4]  The stained glass windows date from 1891 to 1979 and reflect the different styles over that time period.[3]  The spire on the tower was completed in 1978.

Trinity Church is neighbor of the government buildings in <link wikipedia="Regjeringskvartalet" osm="1686281" type="relation">Regjeringskvartalet</link>. It is the parish church of the parish of Trinity, belonging to the Diocese of Oslo of the Church of Norway. It is one of the largest churches in Oslo (1000 seats). The church itself is in the raw red brick, while the vaults, arches and small columns have gray scale color. The nave is octagonal with a Greek cross superimposed, with the choir in the apse, shallow transept and rectangular entrance flanked by two slender, octagonal bell towers. A central dome rises above the church.[1] Trinity Church is the largest church in Oslo and one of the largest of the many octagonal churches in Norway, but one of few octagonal churches constructed in red brick.

      <p id="GL586_157_002" num_links="2">Trinity Church was consecrated in 1858 by Bishop Jens Lauritz Arup. The church has a neo-Gothic central plan, with two towers and eight-sided dome, and was designed by architect Alexis de Chateauneuf (<link wikipedia="Hamburg" osm="20833623 565666208 62782 451087" type="node node relation relation">Hamburg</link>, <link wikipedia="Germany" osm="1683325355 51477 62781" type="node relation relation">Germany</link>), but some time after the work was entrusted to his pupil Wilhelm von Hanno, who made some modifications to the original plans and put his personal stamp on the details of interior decoration. The main body (1872) is the work of Claus Jensen, the altarpiece (1866) is a painting by Adolph Tidemand (the Baptism of Jesus), chandeliers were designed by Emanuel Vigeland in 1923, and Frøydis Haavardsholm was the designer of the stained glass windows.[2][3][4]

Trinity College is widely considered the most prestigious university in Ireland, in part due to its extensive history.[12] In accordance with the formula of ad eundem gradum, a form of recognition that exists among the three universities, a graduate of Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin can be conferred with the equivalent degree at either of the other two universities without further examination.[13] Trinity College, Dublin is a sister college to St John's College, Cambridge and <link wikipedia="Oriel_College,_Oxford" osm="23694356" type="way">Oriel College, Oxford</link>.[14][15]

Alfred George as Missionary.[1]  From 1900 to 1903 it was reorganized as Trinity Church and a new church building was constructed. In 1910 Trinity was named the pro-cathedral by the Rt. Rev. William Hall Moreland.[2] The Very Rev. John R. Atwill was named the first dean. Some of the parishioners objected and petitioned that Trinity be maintained as a parish, but to no avail. Because of financial difficulties Trinity and St. Paul's Church were merged to become Christ Church Cathedral in 1934. Trinity became the Bishop's Chapel at this time and from 1941 to 1945 Cathedral House became a home for servicemen during <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>. Following the war Trinity became a parish again in 1946 and a pro-cathedral in 1948. Ground was broken for the present church building in September 1954. The cornerstone was laid on May 30, 1955.[1]  The cathedral was dedicated on October 23 of the same year. From 1988-1991 the Trinity 2000 Building Program was undertaken and the Great Hall was built.

In 1829 Reverend George T. Chapman, rector of Lexington's Christ Church from 1820 to 1830, proposed the formation of a Diocese. In working towards this goal, Reverend Chapman visited Danville and organized a congregation. The group of local citizens who were instrumental in the formation of the new church were mostly physicians, lawyers, bankers, merchants, and landowners. Members of the committee formed to erect a church building included Dr. Ephraim McDowell and his wife, Sarah Shelby McDowell, daughter of Isaac Shelby, the first Governor of Kentucky. Another influential member and largest contributor to the church was James Birney, a wealthy merchant, who was the father of James G. Birney, the prominent abolitionist.[2]

Its walls are made of multiple colors of granite, and are topped by a steeply pitched slate roof.  There is a large projecting gable section on the southern facade, which, along with the tower in the southeastern corner, has the half-timber styling typical of the Tudor Revival.   The eastern facade has a projecting curved section, which houses the apse on the interior; it is from this section that the church is connected to the parish house via the somewhat utilitarian 1956 addition.  The parish house was designed in Shingle Style by Boston architect and parish member William H. Smith, although with sympathy to the Tudor styling of the church.[2]

Records indicate that Episcopal services were conducted as early as 1815 by itinerant clergymen, but there was not a building so services were conducted in the county court.  In 1843, the Rt. Rev. Wm. Meade, Bishop of Virginia, sent the Rev. Tho. Smith to be the vicar of a small congregation.  The church property was given by John Snodgrass, a member of congress from this district.  The first church's building began in 1846, and Rev. Smith died at age 48, before its completion.  He was buried, by his request, under the front steps.  He felt he was "a poor sinner and wanted to be trampled under the feet of all who entered."  The first church was completed in 1850, with the rectory built in 1863, and occupied until 1919, when it was turned into office buildings and Sunday school rooms.  The old church was torn down in 1878, and the present building completed and consecrated in 1879.  The church's foundation stones come from Quincy Hill quarry.  In 1913, the church was flooded and pews were taken up and stored higher, but the organ, furnaces and floor was destroyed.  Another flood occurred in 1937, however, this one was not as severe, yet the pews were replaced.

It was later reconstructed by emperor Tiberius to celebrate the victories of Germanicus over the German tribes in Rhineland.[4] The arch contains an inscription dedicated to emperor Tiberius in AD 27.[5] On the northern (outward-facing) facade, the architrave and cornice have been cut back and a bronze inscription inserted, now lost; attempts at reconstructing its text from the placement of cramp holes for the projecting tines of its letters have not been successful.[6] The arch is decorated with various reliefs of military themes, including naval battles, spoils of war and Romans battling Germanics and Gauls. A Roman foot soldier carrying the shield of Legio II Augusta is seen on the north front battle relief.[5]

</p>
      <p id="GL586_298_002" num_links="2">The arch was built into the town's walling during the Middle Ages to guard the northern entry points of the town.[4] Architect Augustin Caristie studied the arch and carried out restoration work in the 1850s.[5] The arch was originally constructed using large unmortared limestone blocks. It has three arches, the center one being larger than the flanking ones. The entire structure measures 19.57 meters long by 8.40 meters wide, standing to a height of 19.21 meters.[4] Each façade has four semi-engaged Corinthian columns. The arch is the oldest surviving example of a design that was used later in Rome itself, for the <link wikipedia="Arch_of_Septimius_Severus" osm="49824161" type="way">Arch of Septimius Severus</link> and the <link wikipedia="Arch_of_Constantine" osm="23590989" type="way">Arch of Constantine</link>.

Historically, in the English language this city was known as Three Rivers. Since the late 20th century, when there has been more recognition of Quebec and French speakers, and French was made an official language, the city is generally referred to as Trois-Rivières in both English and French. The anglicized name still appears in many areas of the town (e.g., the city's Three Rivers Academy), bearing witness to the influence of English settlers in the town. The city's inhabitants are known as Trifluviens (Trifluvians).

The tower has borne several names, including Rizopolozhenskaya, Znamenskaya, and Karetnaya. It received its current name in 1658 from the Troitskaya Coaching Inn (Троицкое подворье) in the Kremlin. The two-story basement of the tower housed a <link wikipedia="Prison" osm="196399500 8710408" type="way relation">prison</link> in the 16th–17th centuries. There is the Troitsky Bridge, which is protected by the Kutafia Tower and leads to the gates of the Troitskaya Tower. There was also a clock on top of the tower between 1585 and 1812. In 1707, due to a threat of <link wikipedia="Sweden" osm="424313277 52822" type="node relation">Swedish</link> invasion, the gun slots of the Troitskaya Tower were enlarged to fit heavy <link wikipedia="Cannon" osm="243045721" type="node">cannons</link>. In 1935, the Soviets installed a red star on top of the Troitskaya Tower. Prior to Soviet rule the tower had an icon of the Holy Trinity atop its outward face.  Because this tower was the formal entrance for huge Communist Party Congresses the icon was totally removed rather than just plastered over as were those on the Spasskaya and Nikolskaya Towers.

      <p id="GL586_461_001" num_links="5">Tronador (in Spanish Cerro Tronador) is an extinct stratovolcano in the southern <link wikipedia="Andes" osm="3446705497" type="node">Andes</link>, located along the border between <link wikipedia="Argentina" osm="249399280 286393" type="node relation">Argentina</link> and <link wikipedia="Chile" osm="424311104 167454" type="node relation">Chile</link>, near the Argentine city of <link wikipedia="Bariloche" osm="198419670" type="node">Bariloche</link>. The mountain was named Tronador (Spanish for Thunderer) by locals in reference to the sound of falling seracs. With an altitude of 3,470 m, Tronador stands more than 1000 m above nearby mountains in the Andean massif, making it a popular mountaineering destination. Located inside two National Parks, <link wikipedia="Nahuel_Huapi_National_Park" osm="2744139" type="relation">Nahuel Huapi</link> in Argentina and Vicente Pérez Rosales in Chile, Tronador hosts a total of eight glaciers, which are currently retreating due to warming of the upper troposphere.[3]

</p>
      <p id="GL586_461_002" num_links="3">Tronador is in the Wet Andes, a zone of high precipitation of both snow and rain. The humid temperate climate of the southern Andes allows several glaciers to develop due to high accumulation rates. Most of the precipitation is produced by western frontal systems from the <link wikipedia="Pacific_Ocean" osm="305640005" type="node">Pacific</link>. Located in the middle of the Andean massif at a latitude of 41° S Tronador is part of an alpine landscape of fjords, glacial lakes and u-shaped valleys. The forming of the landscape took place during the Quaternary glaciations, periods during which the whole area was covered by the Patagonian Ice Sheet. The volcano grew during the glacials and interglacials of the Pleistocene but became practically extinct in late Middle Pleistocene 300 ka ago, due to a shift in the active front of the Southern Volcanic Zone to which it belongs.[4] Since then, glaciations and other erosive processes shaped the mountain freely without new output of lava or tephra. As in the case of nearby Lanín volcano Tronador is built up mostly of basalts, and has seen a decline in activity as the <link wikipedia="Osorno_(volcano)" osm="84204260" type="node">Osorno</link> and <link wikipedia="Calbuco_(volcano)" osm="86637068" type="node">Calbuco</link> volcanoes grow further west.
