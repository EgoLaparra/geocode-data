After a fire in the 1990s, the city replaced walls and the press box. Also, the city upgraded the lighting thanks to a USDA grant. Several years ago, the city began limiting stadium use to only regular football games to help preserve the sod.

The community is located along Texas State Highway 6 around 8 miles to the west of the City of <link wikipedia="Waco,_Texas" osm="151563130 113870" type="node relation">Waco</link> on the western edge of Lake Waco. The population of Speegleville was 111 at the time of the 2000 Census. As of 2010 Speegleville continued to maintain a volunteer fire department, elementary school, and 3 churches. Speegleville Park is a US Army Corps of Engineers maintained recreational area with a public beach and campgrounds located on Lake Waco.
Speegleville was named for Israel Washington Speegle, a blacksmith and farmer who came to the area from Jasper County, Missouri, in 1849. A Baptist congregation, which was organized in 1859 as the Pleasant Grove Church, shared a building with the local school. The Speegleville post office operated from 1879 until 1929. Speegle was the first postmaster. Speegleville had a population of twenty-five in the mid-1880s and fifty by the early 1890s. In 1896 the community had two general stores, and the principal occupation of area residents was stock raising. That year the Speegleville school district had seventy-seven students and one teacher. Construction of Waco Dam in the late 1920s forced several residents to move their homes or businesses. Residents were forced to move again in the late 1950s and early 1960s because of the construction of the new Lake Waco dam. The original townsite was destroyed, and Speegleville became a scattered collection of houses instead of an organized town. The Speegleville Independent School District was consolidated with the Midway Independent School District in 1980. Population estimates for the community remained at 111 from 1900 through 2000.
Notable people that have lived in Speegleville.
Congressman Joe Barton worked for his uncle Calvin Buice at the Speegleville Store when he was a teenager during the summers.
Johnny Watkins hosted a farm and ranch show on channel 6 KCEN and was a local celebrity.

      <p id="GL586_125_002" num_links="3">The City of Moultrie gained its first official municipal airport, Clark Field, in the 1930s. In 1940, local leaders, aware of the Federal government's airport building program, formed a committee to represent the community. The committee then contacted the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) about the possibility of acquiring a modern CAA built airport at Moultrie. The CAA, receptive to the idea, informed the committee that once the local government provided the land the Federal government would fund the building of an airfield. Due to the impossibility of expanding Clark Field for a modern airport, Moultrie and <link wikipedia="Colquitt_County,_Georgia" osm="1027986" type="relation">Colquitt County</link> then took an option on a tract of land northeast of the city.

In June, after the War Department approved the second site, Moultrie and Colquitt County purchased the 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) involved.

Instead of creating a traditional "company" town in which the workers rented houses Southern sold the lots to workers or businesses for $100 apiece. The deeds did contain restrictive covenants which maintained that a dwelling costing in excess of $400 and approved by a Southern appointed architect be built within a year. The Southern donated lots for religious institutions.

      <p id="GL586_226_001" num_links="5">According to Elogius Kiburger, the author of the Strättliger Chronicle, in 933 the King of Burgundy, Rudolph II, built the Castle.  Shortly thereafter, the Freiherr von Strättligen settled in the castle.  Portions of the current castle shield walls and main tower were built during the 12th century and by the 13th century the town of Spiez existed outside the castle walls.  By 1280 the castle was listed as an Imperial fief under Vogt Richard de Corbières.  In 1289 the Freiherr von Strättligen was co-owner of the castle along with a succession of other noble families.  In 1308 King Albert I of Habsburg was murdered at <link wikipedia="Windisch" osm="102305182 1684461" type="node relation">Windisch</link> on the <link wikipedia="Reuss_(river)" osm="2185933" type="relation">Reuss</link>, by his nephew Duke John Parricida.  As part of their retaliation for the murder, the Habsburgs withdrew half of the Spiez fief from Thüring von Brandis and granted the whole fief to Johannes von Strättligen.  Thirty years later, in 1338, Johannes sold the castle, town, church and surrounding villages to Johann II von Bubenberg who was the Schultheiss of <link wikipedia="Bern" osm="18477455 1682378" type="node relation">Bern</link>.  By 1340, the Bubenberg appointed vogt took orders from Bern, but was obligated to raise troops for the Habsburgs.  As Bern was de facto independent from their former overlords, the Habsburgs, this created an unstable situation which remained for over 40 years.  After the Bernese and Swiss Confederation victory over the Habsburgs in the <link wikipedia="Battle_of_Sempach" osm="6289121040" type="node">Battle of Sempach</link> in 1386, the Habsburgs gave up their land claims west of the <link wikipedia="Aare" osm="2192950" type="relation">Aare</link>, which included Spiez.[2]

There is a sixth form.  The school has dual specialist status in business and enterprise, and in visual, creative and performing arts. Spires is independently governed, but funded by the sponsors and the Department for Children, Schools and Families. As a non-selective school the school does not insist on prospective pupils passing the eleven-plus examination for entry, and it is free to attend. The Academy is subject, like other schools, to regular inspections, but is managed by an ‘Academy Trust’ rather than a local education authority. According to Ofsted inspectors, boys do worse at maths at the school, and generally the school needs to improve (academically).

When Lotsewa Rinchen Zangpo (Translator) came to that place he said that an exemplary religious community would arise there and so the monastery was called spituk (exemplary). During the time of Dharma raja Gragspa Bum-Ide the monastery was restored by Lama Lhawang Lodos and the stainless order of Tsonkhapa was introduced and it has remained intact as such till present. Founded as a Red Hat institution, the monastery was taken over by the Yellow Hat sect in the 15th century.
