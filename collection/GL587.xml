Spring Garden is a neighborhood that combines diverse residential neighborhoods and significant cultural attractions.  The residential areas on the north side of the neighborhood (North of Spring Garden Street) are composed mostly of brick and brownstone three-story townhouses built during the mid-to-late 19th century.  The houses include townhouses in the Italianate style, Second Empire, Queen Anne, and Venetian Gothic.  Many streets (including Green Street and Spring Garden Street) include "terraced" set ups, which include a small gardened plot, often raised, in front of the house.[2]  The residential areas to the south are dominated by taller, multi-family buildings built during the 20th century.

The developers originally wanted to call the community Spring Lake and used that as the working name through the development process. They were forced to use a different name due to the name Spring Lake already being in use locally and chose Spring Hill.[6] The plans for the community are identical to the community of <link wikipedia="Deltona,_Florida" osm="154104573 117940" type="node relation">Deltona</link>. The Mackle Brothers sold many of the properties and land in the area through intense advertising.[7] It has since become a sprawling semi-city in its own right, though it is an unincorporated area.

Ballance began using the name "Springfield Armory" through his company (LH Manufacturing) dedicated to the first civilian production of the M14 rifle, calling it the M1A.  Ballance began in <link wikipedia="San_Antonio" osm="27090054 253556" type="node relation">San Antonio, Texas</link>, and soon after moved to Devine, Texas, where the company gained momentum and popularity. In 1974, Ballance sold the company to the Reese family, who had a well-established production shop in <link wikipedia="Illinois" osm="553784069 122586" type="node relation">Illinois</link> and experience base. The company then expanded its market into pistols, including the M1911.  After further success, the company began to branch into other types of firearms. The company, now run by Dennis Reese (formally along with his brother Tom Reese), manufactures and imports dozens of different firearms in many styles and models.  A motto used by the company, "The First Name in American Firearms" (alternatively "The Oldest Name in American Firearms"), is an homage to the first U.S. national armory and namesake, the original Springfield Armory.[4][non-primary source needed] There is no other connection between the company and defunct federal armory other than its name.

The upper areas, away from the mills, were typically developed by individuals engaged as skilled laborers or management in the mills.

Once the four wards were developed in the mid-1730s, two additional wards were laid out. The layout of a square and eight surrounding blocks was known as a "ward." The original plan (now known as the Oglethorpe Plan) was part of a larger regional plan that included gardens, farms, and "out-lying villages." While some authorities believe that the original plan allowed for growth of the city and thus expansion of the grid, the regional plan suggests otherwise: the ratio of town lots to country lots was in balance and growth of the urban grid would have destroyed that balance.[1]

The 2011 Census of India put the total population of Sri Muktsar Sahib municipality to 117,085,[1] making it the 14th largest city of Punjab, in terms of population. Historically known as Khidrana or Khidrane di dhab, the city was made the district headquarters in 1995. Chronological evidence indicates that the city was named Muktsar after the battle of Muktsar in 1705. The government officially changed the name of the city to Sri Muktsar Sahib in 2012,[2] though the city is still primarily referred to by its unofficial name – Muktsar.
