It is the oldest church of the Anglican Communion and Episcopal tradition in the Chicago area, having been founded in 1834.[1] Originally built as a parish church, that building was mostly destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire.  Only the bell tower survived, and this was incorporated into the rebuilt church, including the soot-stained stones around the top of the tower which remain black today.  St. James received the status of cathedral in 1928 after the Cathedral Church of St. Peter and St. Paul was destroyed in a fire in 1921, but the arrangement was terminated in 1931.  On May 3, 1955, St. James was again designated the cathedral and was formally set apart on June 4, 1955.[2]  The church is led by the Episcopal Bishop of Chicago.

In a poker game in 1873 Barth earned enough money to purchase cattle and enough land in St. Johns to start a ranch with his brothers Nathan and Morris. He changed the name from El Vadito to San Juan.  There is some controversy as to whether this was in honor of the first woman resident, Maria San Juan Baca de Padilla, or of the feast of San Juan. William R. Milligan arrived in 1866, followed by Frank Walker in 1870. By 1872 a Spanish-American agricultural community had developed. A stone cabin was erected by Juan Sedilla in 1874. Solomon Barth sold out to Mormon Ammon M. Tenney in 1875 or 1879. A Mormon community named Salem and led by David King Udall was established just north of the town under the direction of Wilford Woodruff on March 29, 1880, and then moved to higher ground by Erastus Snow on September 19 of the same year.[8][9][10]

When his first child was about to be born, he attended Mass in <link wikipedia="Detroit" osm="18994998 134591" type="node relation">Detroit</link>, and put his last $7.00 in the offering bin.

The Cistercians took control of the chapel until the secularisation of law in 1810. Between 1810 and 1850, the chapel lost its sacramental function, during which the Baroque altar was moved to St. Anne's Chapel in <link wikipedia="Sosnówka,_Jelenia_Góra_County" osm="2945124" type="relation">Sosnówka</link>.[3] The building began to function as a mountain hut. The chapel was restored in 1850, by Friedrich Sommer, which returned the chapel's sacramental function. The chapel was re-immolated in 1850, by Bishop of Wrocław Heinrich Förster.[4] The regularity of sacramental practices was also restored. In 1981, the chapel celebrated its 300-year, with its construction unchanged to the present day.[5]

The school shared this facility with John Cabot Catholic Secondary School and St. Edmund Campion Secondary School. In September 2004, the school moved to its new permanent facility at Mavis Road and Courtneypark Drive West. The state of the art institution is part of a shared facility agreement with the City of Mississauga. The campus includes the second largest library in the City of Mississauga and a track and field complex that boasts a $1,000,000 artificial field and an 8 lane all weather track. St. Marcellinus Secondary School is well known for academic excellence and athletic expertise with a wide variety of clubs and arts activities.

      <p id="GL589_476_002" num_links="2">Delaware's first Masses were celebrated by travelling priests in the homes of the city's few Catholics,[2] most of whom were Irish or German immigrants.[3]  The members built the first St. Mary's Church in 1850, but six years passed before Archbishop Purcell appointed the first priest to serve as the pastor.  This man, Casper Wiese, quickly founded a <link wikipedia="Catholic_school" osm="4636800063" type="node">parish school</link> and bought a piece of land for use as a parish cemetery.  A series of short-tenured pastorates followed Wiese's four-year time; the longest, that of Henry Fehlings, ended during the process of regional reorganization following the creation of the Diocese of Columbus.  Fehlings' pastorate saw the parish expand outward from its small frame building: a brick addition to the church was constructed in 1865, a nearby store was purchased and converted into premises for the parish school, and a nearby house was purchased and converted into a rectory.  By 1880, the parish had reached a membership of approximately seven hundred.[2]  In 1886, the present house of worship was constructed on <link wikipedia="U.S._Route_36" osm="443217 2308748 2308749" type="relation relation relation">William Street</link> near downtown.[1]
