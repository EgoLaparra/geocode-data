There are no records as to when the present church was built, but the work was probably started in the mid or late 15th century. According to Markus Hiekkanen, the church was probably built in the 1440s, on the basis of the style of the closets; the gables were constructed about 50 years later. [1] There are medieval limestone paintings on the walls, which are not common to other places in Finland. The most valuable artefacts are the wooden altar cabinet and a large altarpiece depicting Christ on the cross. [2]

The design is attributed to New York architect Frank Wills, a prominent 19th century proponent of the Gothic Revival. Wills' belief in the English Country church as the ideal model for American Episcopal congregations can be clearly seen in the design of St. Mary's. Two other churches by Wills are known in the region, Christ Church in <link wikipedia="Napoleonville,_Louisiana" osm="132162" type="relation">Napoleonville, Louisiana</link> and the Chapel of the Cross near Madison, Mississippi. In 1858 the church was consecrated by Bishop (later Confederate General) Leonidas Polk, the "Fighting Bishop" of Civil War fame. The church was built on the Old East Tunica Road on 5 acres donated by Sarah Mulford, The title description is written "per aversionem" so that the boundaries cannot be identified exactly. In 1928 State Highway 66 was built about 1/2 mile west of the church and the old road was abandoned, leaving the church with no vehicular access, except by private farm roads. The church was deconsecrated in 1947, and today stands empty, gradually being overtaken by the surrounding forest, which has completely overgrown the graveyard north of the church and the old roadway.

On one side was a long seminary building and on the other was an L-shaped larger, but similar architectured structure built for the secular College, after it was established in 1805.  These were later replaced on the same site by buildings in 1876-78 of Victorian/Second Empire style with mansard roofs although the central chapel of Godefroy endured. In the 1970s, the Victorian buildings were unfortunately also razed leaving St. Mary's Park with a historic bandstand to now surround the old Chapel and Mother Seton House. To the east in the 1980s was constructed a four-lane landscaped parkway with median strip of the Martin Luther King, Jr.  Boulevard, edged by short brick retaining walls which curved around the west side of downtown Baltimore like an inner "beltway".

      <p id="GL590_370_002" num_links="2">None of <link wikipedia="Clark_County,_Ohio" osm="180912" type="relation">Clark County's</link> first residents were Catholics; the first Catholics moved into Springfield circa 1835, and by 1845, the community had nearly seventy Catholic families.  The first priest to minister in Springfield was Henry Damian Juncker, the future Bishop of Alton, but his responsibilities elsewhere permitted him to visit Springfield only once or twice monthly, and services were held in private residences or in buildings owned by others.  James F. Kearney was the first resident priest, coming in August 1840, but due to illness he resigned after one year's service.[2]:503  The members bought land in 1848, and the parish was officially erected in 1849 and dedicated to St. Raphael.[3]:420  Although money was originally lacking for the construction of a building, the parish's needs were supplied by wealthy Cincinnati resident Michael Cassily, and with his money the members built the foundation of a church building.  Over the next quarter century, twelve different priests served the parish, holding tenures ranging from one to eighteen years.  By the late 1860s, the parish was growing to the point that a single priest could no longer serve everyone: an assistant pastor was appointed in 1868,[2]:503 even though a second parish, St. Bernard, had been formed in 1860.[3]:401  Another parish, <link wikipedia="St._Joseph's_Catholic_Church_(Springfield,_Ohio)" osm="357458844" type="node">St. Joseph</link>, was established in 1884.[2]:506

At that time the Sint-Donaaskathedraal (St. Donatian's Cathedral), which was located at the very heart of Bruges, opposite of the town hall, was the central religious building of the city. In 1116 a new fire destroyed the building and in 1127 and the construction of a new larger church began in Romanesque style.

      <p id="GL590_421_001" num_links="2">By the middle of the 12th century, Vienna had become an important centre of German civilization, and the four existing churches, including only one parish church, no longer met the town's religious needs. In 1137, Bishop of Passau Reginmar and Margrave Leopold IV signed the Treaty of Mautern, which referred to Vienna as a civitas for the first time and transferred <link wikipedia="Peterskirche,_Vienna" osm="23329490" type="way">St. Peter's Church</link> to the Diocese of Passau. Under the treaty, Margrave Leopold IV also received from the bishop extended stretches of land beyond the city walls, with the notable exception of the territory allocated for the new parish church, which would eventually become St. Stephen's Cathedral. Although previously believed built in an open field outside the city walls, the new parish church was in actuality likely built on an ancient cemetery dating to Ancient Roman times; excavations for a heating system in 2000 revealed graves 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) below the surface, which were carbon-dated to the 4th century.[citation needed] This discovery suggests that an even older religious building on this site predated the <link wikipedia="St._Rupert's_Church,_Vienna" osm="107807203" type="way">St. Rupert's Church</link>, which is considered the oldest church in Vienna

An avid collector and admirer of relics, he obtained the remains of St. Stephen in Rome and donated them to the church. The St. Stephen Church served as a parish church for the upper part of New Town (in the lower part of New Town this function is fulfilled by the Church of St Henry and St Kunnigunde). At first the church was managed by the order of Knights of the Cross with the Red Star (Czech: Křižovníci), just when Charles IV. received most of the land for the founding of New Town.[1] The church was built in the years 1351 – 1401, when the main builder master George is mentioned. Completion of the western tower is dated to the year 1401, when the whole church must have already been built. The church also had a large lot, filling most of the space between the present-day streets Štěpánská, Ječná, Na Rybníčku and Žitná. There was a parish garden and a large <link wikipedia="Cemetery" osm="24217949" type="way">cemetery</link>. During the plague epidemic in 1502, more than fifteen thousand people were buried there.[2] Several buildings were there: a rectory (in the southwest corner), a school, a wooden belfry (which was rebuilt in stone in the early 17th century), the Chapel of All Saints, Jerusalem chapel,[3] as well as the rotunda of St. Login.
In 1686, the Cornel Chapel was built to the south wall of the nave and then the Branber Chapel to the north wall of the sacristy, which was opened in 1739. In 1866 a Neo-Gothic hall was built in the north part of the nave. A known restorer of that time, <link wikipedia="Josef_Mocker" osm="5620257577" type="node">Josef Mocker</link> redesigned, restored the church in a puristic style in 1874 – 1879. He was responsible for restoring many Bohemian castles and ancient buildings in Prague. His work in a puristic Gothic Revival style aroused much controversy, but also contributed to many important landmarks of Prague. Here Josef Mocker designed a new tracery in the presbytery, a new window in the nave, and also a frontage in the aisle. 
Nowadays, the church is managed by <link wikipedia="Catholic_Church" osm="618656792" type="way">Roman Catholic</link> parish of St. Stephen and is owned by the Archdiocese of Prague.

Christ the King Roman Catholic Church, Long Branch was formed out of St. Theresa's in 1939 to serve the growing village (former sea side resort) to the west.  With the end of the war, many Polish families began to move into the area from war-torn Europe, taking work at local industries; this led to the 1957 founding of <link wikipedia="New_Toronto" osm="558610571" type="node">St. Teresa Catholic Elementary School</link> beside the church.
