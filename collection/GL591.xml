Built between 1885 and 1886 in the Early English Gothic style by Sir Arthur Blomfield, "one of the last great Gothic revivalists",[1] the church was embroiled in controversy as soon as it was founded.  During a period of religious unrest in the town, theological tensions within Anglicanism between High church Anglo-Catholics and Low church Anglicans were inflamed by what the latter group saw as the church's "idolatrous" Roman Catholic-style fittings—in particular, a statue of the <link wikipedia="Mary,_mother_of_Jesus" osm="2363258019 6262336190" type="node node">Virgin Mary</link> which was seized upon by opponents as an example of a reversion to Catholic-style worship in the Church of England.  The "Worthing Madonna" dispute[2] delayed the consecration of the church by several years.

Together with its 'Pre-Prep – Early Years' department, the school educates girls and boys aged between three and thirteen. In 2011, there were 266 children at the school, of whom 155 were boys and 111 were girls.
The school has a Christian ethos, and its chapel services are reported to be "broadly Anglican in style". The most important religious event of the school year is the Advent Carol Service, which because of the numbers attending is held not at the school but in the larger chapel of nearby Bradfield College.

Restoration work in 1840 uncovered a 12th-century arch in the west wall, which may have been the original chancel arch or a doorway to a western tower that has been lost.

Alterations were made in the 16th century, when the large east window in Perpendicular style was added to the chancel – a window which has been described by one guide to the buildings of north Wales as "almost too big to fit" in the wall.[3] Some restoration work took place in the mid-19th century, when further windows were added and the chancel largely rebuilt.

Under this arrangement, the Springfield House school flourished, and by the early 1850s was already enticing pupils away from Erasmus Smith College, College Road. Springfield pupils were conspicuously successful in obtaining scholarships to the Queen's Colleges at <link wikipedia="Galway" osm="582043319 1390623" type="node relation">Galway</link> and <link wikipedia="Cork_(city)" osm="1422314245" type="node">Cork</link> (now NUI Galway and University College Cork). In 1859, Fitzsimons added a new wing to the college in order to cater for the increased number of students. The same year, Springfield affiliated to the newly established University of London as a preparatory college. In 1862, financial difficulties caused Fitzsimons to terminate his connection with Springfield, and under his successor the College changed directions sharply. The affiliation with the University of London was dropped for one with Newman's Catholic University in Dublin. Fitzsimons, for his part, embarked on a new career in <link wikipedia="Argentina" osm="249399280 286393" type="node relation">Argentina</link>, and within the space of a few years set up four schools.

      <p id="GL591_500_002" num_links="2">From 1799, a Roman Catholic chapel existed in Lincoln. It was at the junction of Broadgate and Silver Street. In 1870, Thomas Young of Kingerby Hall, who had been behind the construction of several Catholic churches in Lincolnshire,[3] drew up plans to build in a church in its place. These plans came to nothing, so in 1886, the mayor of Lincoln, Francis Clarke, put forward £7,000 to build a church in the same place. He hired Albert Vicars, who designed <link wikipedia="St_Anne's_Church,_Birmingham" osm="73536988" type="way">St Anne's Church</link> in Birmingham and helped design <link wikipedia="St_Peter's_Cathedral,_Belfast" osm="201235638" type="way">St Peter's Cathedral</link> in Belfast. Francis Clarke died in 1888, and £3,500 was given for the church's construction by his estate trustees.  By 1892, enough money had been collected to build the church.[4]
