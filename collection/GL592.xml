Its origins are earlier, as a clas church from the 5th to the 7th centuries. Further building, including the construction of the second nave, took place in the late 15th or early 16th centuries. Its importance was as an embarkation point for the abbey on <link wikipedia="Bardsey_Island" osm="6046655" type="relation">Bardsey Island</link> which became a significant site of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages. The Reformation saw the church's decline, and by the 19th century it was a ruin. In the 1850s a new church, Eglwys Newydd, was constructed inland, but proved so unpopular that St Hywyn's was restored. The Welsh poet R. S. Thomas was minister at the church, which is a Grade I listed building.

It is alleged that it was originally used as an escape tunnel for the monks when the Yarm School area was a catholic house. The Dominican Friars, Black Friars, occupied a site in Yarm from 1286 to 1583.
It is part of a long history and many more are buried in the church yard than there are gravestones for - some graves marked with just one name actually contain up to four people, since people have been buried there for hundreds and hundreds of years, grave stones only being introduced recently. 
There are also legends of spirits of the deceased buried in the cemetery, two gardeners, father and son, and the former owner of The Bluebell in Yarm. When you enter the church, directly to the left of the porch is an Anglo-Saxon coffin top that was discovered on-site and inside there are many more historical wonders from all dates.

It was a three-storey building, constructed of local stone, and would have stood at least 22 metres (72 ft) high. At a later point, probably during the English Civil War, the tower was deliberately damaged to prevent it being used for military purposes, and its uppermost storey was demolished. Concerns grew about the tower's condition in the 20th century and in 1937 it was taken into the guardianship of the state. In the 21st century, it is managed by English Heritage and the exterior is open to visitors.

The congregation was originally independent (not linked to any Christian denomination) before taking up Presbyterianism, and worshipped in a private house from its founding in 1853 until a permanent church was provided in 1857; this was one of the oldest Presbyterian places of worship in southeast England.  The growth of the community has resulted in several extensions since then, and severe damage caused by the Great Storm of 1987 was quickly repaired—except for the loss of the building's distinctive spire.  The church, along with most other Presbyterian congregations, joined the United Reformed Church when that denomination was formed in 1972.  It is one of four United Reformed Churches in the borough of Hastings.

There is evidence that, following the establishment of their own Chapelry, the people of Crossgate resented still having to attend the Parish Church at certain times, and still having to pay certain dues. One dispute in 1343 culminated in the Prior having the font removed from St Margaret's; only for it to be returned at the command of the Bishop (albeit with a warning which made it clear that the parishioners had no right to use it). It was not long afterwards, however, that residents of the Chapelry were granted the right to be married, churched and baptized in St Margaret's; and in 1431 the surrounding Church Garth was consecrated to allow the dead to be buried there.[1]

Originally intended as the private chapel of the adjacent St Mary's Hall school, it was partly built in 1838 at the request of Frederick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol; but arguments over whether or not it should also be open to the public delayed its completion for more than 10 years.  It became the parish church of Kemptown in 1873, but declining attendances resulted in a declaration of redundancy in 1986.  At that time it was taken over by the school and became its chapel, nearly 150 years after this was first proposed.

Roads such as Eastern Road and Bristol Road ran from west to east towards Kemp Town, and high-density housing branched off on roads to the north and south.  This area became known as Kemptown  [sic].[1][2]  Kemp owned much of the land in the area, but in the 1820s he sold about 150 acres (61 ha) to Frederick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol.  He had succeeded to the Earldom of Bristol when his father, the 4th Earl of Bristol (known as the Earl-Bishop), died in 1803.[3]  The Marquess, who assumed that title in 1826, was interested in church-building and works of charity.  Soon after buying the land, he gave a portion to Reverend Henry Venn Elliott to allow him to build St Mary's Hall School.[3]  In 1837, Reverend Elliott began to plan for an Anglican church to serve the area, and the Marquess gave more land next to the school to allow one to be built there.  Construction started in 1838, and the Marquess spent about £2,000 (£181,000 in 2020)[4] to ensure a rapid completion.[5]  However, disagreements soon arose over these plans: the Diocese of Chichester had not approved the proposal to open the church to the public, and had only given permission for the building to be a private chapel for the school; and the Vicar of Brighton, Reverend Henry Michell Wagner, disapproved of its location—it was considered to be too close to <link wikipedia="St_George's_Church,_Brighton" osm="96992829" type="way">St George's Church</link>.

Weakened by additions to the church tower and undermined by burials in and around the church, by the 19th century the building was structurally unsound. The church was remodelled and strengthened in the 1860s by George Gilbert Scott and again in the 20th century by Robert Potter.

The old church building, formally The Church of St Mary The Virgin (shortened to The Church of St Mary) and known colloquially as Old St Mary's or The Old Parish Church, is at the edge of the village, and is estimated to be around 650 years old. It sits at the crest of the Greensand Ridge, offering views over the surrounding countryside. Its graveyard is a haven for wild flowers and wildlife. After the church moved to the village centre, incorporating various items from the old church building, the old building was converted for use as a mortuary chapel, but in the 1950s it fell into ruin.

The Domesday Book of 1086 notes that 'a church is there' but no other records of that building remain. The church on the site today is a Grade II* listed building, over 600 years old, built around 1360.[1] It is in need of repairs, especially the nave roof, estimated to cost around £250,000. The tower was renovated in 1883–1884 with Harehills Stone, which has now weathered almost black, in stark contrast to the creamy yellow of the rest of the exterior.
Thomas Dealtry, rector of Swillington 1872–1878, is credited with having introduced the habit of throwing confetti at weddings, from his observation of rice thrown at Hindu weddings in his previous position as Archdeacon of Madras.[2] His predecessor, the Rev A. F. A. Woodford, rector 1847–1872, was a noted masonic scholar and publisher, and became Grand Chaplain in 1863. He is credited, in 1886, with passing to William Wynn Westcott the Cipher Manuscripts leading to the formation of the Hermetic order of the Golden Dawn.

To this day the aim of the college is to offer a holistic Catholic education. Through the years the boarding numbers in the school built up to the around 160 mark and has since increased in the 1980s when Day-Boys were taken in. At present, there are well over 350 pupils attending the school.[2]

The entrance was not allowed to open on to the highway and Catholic worshippers were required to arrive at the chapel one at a time.  The church was originally set back discreetly from the road, concealed by a row of cottages.  The cottages were demolished in Bucknall's rebuilding, after discrimination against Catholics had been eased.[6]

The absence of grave deposits indicates that this was an early Christian settlement.[1] The first church in Woolwich was probably pre-Norman conquest[2] and dedicated to Saint Lawrence. It stood on a promontory about 37 m north of the present-day church, more or less where the belvedere overlooking the river now is. The church was slightly separate from the early riverside settlement in Old Woolwich. From the early 10th till the mid-12th century Woolwich was ruled by the abbots of <link wikipedia="Saint_Peter's_Abbey,_Ghent" osm="2804440" type="relation">St. Peter's Abbey</link> in <link wikipedia="Ghent" osm="1668655163 897671" type="node relation">Ghent</link>, probably as a result of a gift from Ælfthryth, daughter of King Alfred and Countess of Flanders. Around 1100 Henry I gave the church to Gundulf of Rochester, bishop and prior of <link wikipedia="Rochester_Cathedral" osm="94653456" type="way">Rochester Cathedral</link>. It was probably around this time that the church was rebuilt in stone. The church tower with walls of chalk and flint was partly excavated in 1970.[3]
