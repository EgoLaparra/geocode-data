      <p id="GL593_002_001" num_links="3">The Boltons, a street in Brompton, was farmland until the middle of the 19th century. As part of westward expansion of London the land was developed by Robert Gunter the elder, who planned a residential estate, together with a church, to lend tone to the area.[3][4] The church, built to a design by George Godwin the younger (who was also responsible for <link wikipedia="St_Jude's_Church,_Kensington" osm="80693050" type="way">St Jude's, Courtfield Gardens</link>, and <link wikipedia="St_Luke's_Church,_Redcliffe_Gardens" osm="80693061" type="way">St Luke's Church, Redcliffe Gardens</link>) on land given by Gunter in the centre of the proposed development, was erected before the estate was built[3] and was the first parish to be made out of the larger parish of <link wikipedia="Holy_Trinity_Brompton" osm="35393530" type="way">Holy Trinity, Brompton</link>, which since 1829 had covered much of Brompton.[3] The cost of the church was £6,000 (equivalent to £650,000 in 2019),[5] and the Church Building Commission gave a grant of £85 towards its construction.[6] It was consecrated on 22 October 1850.[4] The church's first incumbent, Rev. Hogarth J. Swale, met most of the building costs of the church.[3] In July 2006 St Mary's Parish absorbed the parish of St Jude's, Courtfield Gardens, doubling its size.[4]

The former east end of that building survives to form the present church, and much 12th-century work remains. It functions as Shoreham-by-Sea's "town church" for major religious and social events, as well as serving its small town-centre parish.  English Heritage has listed it at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance.

The date of its foundation is unclear but it was mentioned in a judgment of 1222, when it was called the Church of the Innocents, or St Mary and the Innocents.[1] It was pulled down in 1549 by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset to make way for Somerset House. The parishioners were promised a new church, which was never built, forcing them to move to the nearby church of <link wikipedia="St_Clement_Danes" osm="25904232" type="way">St Clement Danes</link> and afterwards to the <link wikipedia="Savoy_Chapel" osm="202759278" type="way">Savoy Chapel</link>.[2] The site now occupied by the modern church was formerly occupied by a great maypole which had been the scene of May Day festivities in the 16th and 17th century but was severely decayed by the early 18th century.

Built entirely of Oamaru stone the exterior has weathered more than one would have expected, but inside the church glows with reflected light from the creamy stone which is virtually in its original state." "The interior is bathed in abundant natural light, and with clear glass rather than stained in the high nave windows, the quality of light is enhanced."[3]

To this end they appointed Thomas Archer, one of their fellow commissioners, to design a church in Deptford.[3] Archer also designed <link wikipedia="St_John's,_Smith_Square" osm="118720812" type="way">St John's Smith Square</link> and <link wikipedia="St_Philip's_Cathedral,_Birmingham" osm="17504663" type="way">Birmingham Cathedral</link>.

In 1991, the building was closed due to maintenance and safety concerns. The Parochial Church Council (PCC) and the locals were determined to see that the church remained open and, in fact, was improved. The "A New Heart for Bow" project was born. More than £3,000,000 was raised from more than a dozen sources and philanthropies. Matthew Lloyd Architects was appointed to refurbish the building and enable it to serve the wider community as well as the church. Originally designed to seat 600 worshippers, the worship space was reordered, retaining original features and furnishings, to seat approximately 150. A  'building within a building' was inserted in the nave: a four-storey steel frame clad in tulipwood is supported on curving steel columns to sit above the worship space. Dubbed the Ark, this insertion in effect adds two new floors to accommodate flexible community spaces. In the attic, above the Ark, a ‘universal access’ gymnasium has been inserted along with an office and changing rooms. Balfour Beatty served as the main contractor, and work began in March 2003 and ended over a year later, in May 2004.[2]

The site is  home of Avonmeads Retail Park, a large retail and leisure park with Showcase Cinemas and a Hollywood Bowl ten-pin bowling centre among its tenants.  It was extensively redeveloped in the 15 years to 2007.  A bypass runs over the <link wikipedia="River_Avon,_Bristol" osm="2795108" type="relation">River Avon</link> creating a major transport link from the A4 road in south east Bristol, to junction 3 of the M32 motorway near the city centre.
In past years St Philip's marsh was a housing development for the workers of Bristol's market area (now known as Old Market).  One of St Philip's' more influential residents during the early 1900s was George Townsend, a major property developer of the South Bristol area.  His family home situated in the St Anne's area of Bristol is still standing today and a reminder of Bristol's history. Today there is very little housing in the area making it almost deserted at night, and other than the retail area it does contain one shop, pub, takeaway and Sparke Evans Park.

      <p id="GL593_292_002" num_links="3">When the college was founded,  it was one of seven Jesuit schools in the Netherlands.

The group had the acronym 'WIMACS'. In the 1980s and 1990s, with the exception of St Stanislas College, control of the schools was transferred to the local government, and because of mergers with other conglomerates, eventually those other schools lost their affiliation with the Jesuits.

In 1966 the vicar John Asbridge, frustrated by the chronic shortage of local housing, set up the Shepherds Bush Housing Association to help solve the problems of homelessness and poverty in the area.  Today St Stephen's ministers to a diverse congregation, and serves a hot meal to up to 100 homeless people every Monday.

      <p id="GL593_329_002" num_links="2">The site on which the current church stands was used as a place of worship under the patronage of Thomas the Apostle as early as the sixth century.  In the ninth century, Bishop Adelochus established a magnificent church with adjoining school, however both burned down in 1007, and again in 1144.  In 1196, construction began on the façade of a new, fortress-like building with an imposing steeple, built in the Roman style.  Interrupted several times, the building work was completed in 1521, in the style of the late Gothic. Around 1450, the church commissioned a set of oil on panel paintings dedicated to the Passion of Jesus. Most of the surviving panels of this once scattered set are now kept in the <link wikipedia="Staatliche_Kunsthalle_Karlsruhe" osm="7707245" type="relation">Staatliche Kunsthalle</link> in <link wikipedia="Karlsruhe" osm="240120582 62518" type="node relation">Karlsruhe</link>, which is why the anonymous master who painted them earned the notname of ″Master of the Karlsruhe Passion″. It is assumed that he is identical with the painter Hans Hirtz, recorded in Strasbourg before 1460. The upper right angle of the Christ Carrying the Cross shows the St. Thomas Church as it still looks today.

Only the chancel of the old church survived in its harbourside location of "sequestered leafiness",[1] resembling a cemetery chapel in the middle of its graveyard.  It was rededicated to St Wilfrid—7th-century founder of a now vanished cathedral at Selsey—and served as a chapel of ease until the Diocese of Chichester declared it redundant in 1990.

The park was originally established in 1970, conserving a 98-square-kilometre (38 sq mi) area of forest surrounding the river.  In 2002, the park was vastly expanded to cover a total of 747 square kilometres (288 sq mi).[2]
