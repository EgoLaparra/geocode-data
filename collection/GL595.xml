It was once accessible by branches of the King's Highway, and is situated in the semi-arid steppe region of the Jordanian Desert. The site has been allied to the biblical settlement of Mephaat mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah. The Roman military utilized the site as a strategic garrison, but it was later converted and inhabited by Christian and Islamic communities. In 2004, the site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[1] and is valued by archaeologists for its extensive ruins dating to the Roman, Byzantine, and early Muslim periods. Studium Biblicum Franciscanum[2] carried out excavations at the north end of the site in 1986, but much of the area remains buried under debris.

Eusebius of Caesarea identified Mephaat as the camp site of a Roman army near the desert in his Onomasticon (K.128:21).[6] Also, the excavation of a Byzantine church here exposed an inscription naming the area as "Castron Mephaa" further supporting the theory that Umm-ar Rasas and the biblical Mephaat are one and the same.[7]

This will in turn provide unique opportunities for eco-tourism that will benefit all local communities and stakeholders as well as the environment and ecology.

Union Bank Tower was the first of Canada's tallest buildings to incorporate a steel skeleton structure that fully supports a light-weight, veneer 'curtain wall' facade, the design innovation that facilitated the proliferation of skyscrapers in the 20th century. This feature solidifies Union Bank Tower's place as the first building in Canada's modern skyscraper lineage. Earlier tall buildings in Toronto (Temple Building) and Montreal (New York Life Insurance Building) used the centuries-old method of load bearing facades, that were more than one meter thick at the ground. At the time of opening, the top floor of Union Bank was the second-highest in the British Empire, one metre below London’s tallest building. It had the largest and fastest elevator in Western Canada and was the first building in Canada to introduce the modern concept of a general contractor to oversee construction. Initially built for Union Bank, it remained vacant for 18 years, until it was redeveloped into the Paterson Global Foods Institute and student housing for Red River College in 2013.[3][4]  It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996.[5]

The granite church was designed by New York architect William J. Beardsley and built in 1905 under the leadership of Rev. Harvey Johnson.  The Gothic Revival structure features steeply pitched roofs, lancet windows, and distinctive buttressing on the front facade to provide support for the walls on a constrained lot size.  The church was built for a predominantly African-American congregation established in 1852; its minister from 1872 to 1923, Rev. Harvey Johnson, was a prominent voice in the civil rights movement.[2]

Designed by noted American architect Cass Gilbert, the beaux-arts Union Station was completed and opened in 1920[4] after the previous Union Station (which was located at the foot of Meadow Street, near the site of the current Union Station parking garage) was destroyed by fire. It served the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad until it fell into decline, along with the rest of the railroad industry in North America after <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>. It was shuttered in 1972, leaving only the under-track 'subway' open for passengers, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 3, 1975,[2] but it was almost demolished before the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project in 1979. Reopened after extensive renovations in early 1985, it is now the premier gateway to the city.
