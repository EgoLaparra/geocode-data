For a brief time, Samuel Langhorne Clemens lived there and prospected, but left without having had much success. Currently, the hamlet consists of a single business – a tourist inn – and a few small houses clustered along or near the gravel roadway which permits vehicular ingress and egress.

During that time, the population was reported to be as high as 1,500 persons. Mark Twain arrived in Unionville with the intention of prospecting for silver in 1862, describing the town as consisting of "eleven cabins and a liberty-pole".  As is common in most mining communities, after the boom, the town experienced a decline soon afterwards.  By 1870, it was discovered that there was little rich ore in the district.  The decline was speeded by the completion of the Central Pacific Railroad through the Humboldt valley, and the establishment of Winnemucca as a major trading and shipping center.[2]

All of the interior changes were reversed in the late 20th century, restoring it to its original form.  The tower, whose steeple was replaced after the New England Hurricane of 1938, was retained.[2]

During this period, urban post offices often shared a building with courts and other federal offices. Houston competed unsuccessfully with <link wikipedia="Galveston,_Texas" osm="54611749 114559" type="node relation">Galveston</link> during the latter portion of the 19th century, until the 1900 hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster in United States history, devastated Galveston. The risk to businesses, particularly shipping, caused many companies to move their facilities to the safer, sheltered port of Houston. By 1910, seventeen railroads moved passengers and freight to and from Houston. As Houston grew, the demand for postal facilities and other federal services increased and a new building to house them was needed.[2]

An octagonal Moorish dome marks one of the front corners; both the main building and the dome have tile roofs.

Unity Temple is considered to be one of Wright's most important structures dating from the first decade of the twentieth century.[3]  Because of its consolidation of aesthetic intent and structure through use of a single material, reinforced concrete, Unity Temple is considered by many architects to be the first modern building in the world. This idea became of central importance to the modern architects who followed Wright, such as Mies Van Der Rohe, and even the post-modernists, such as Frank Gehry.

Despite its name, it is not a university (a status that can only be conferred by the government under certain conditions to larger institutions), but a limited company involved in research and some university-level education. The main idea behind establishing UNIS was that the unique geographic location of the island permits the study of Arctic sciences in situ, right outside the company walls. Its official language is Norwegian, but English is used in all tuition and 68% of its 690 students originate from outside Norway (in 2015, foreign students came from 43 countries).[1] Of the international students, the largest groups were from Nordic countries outside Norway (12%), Germany (11%), the Netherlands (9%), the United Kingdom (6%), and Russia (6%). The tuition is free of charge and is carried out by 27 full-time professors, 43 adjunct professors and 160 guest lecturers. The latter are invited from Norwegian and foreign institutions within various joint research projects.[2] Those projects are also instrumental for the enrollment of master and PhD students – UNIS does not accept its own graduates for those courses and requires potential candidates to present a letter of support from their home institution.[3] One important collaboration is the educational exchange program with Russia. The funding for UNIS is provided by the Norwegian government, research councils and private industry.[1]

The Library keeps its name because it refers to the original close contact towards the university and at the same time reflects the universal character of its collections. 
As the time passed by the authorities set further goals and competences for ULB within the national and international framework. ULB has become the first library entitled to the legal deposit from the territory of <link wikipedia="Slovakia" osm="432425079 14296" type="node relation">Slovakia</link>, and it is the only one which has kept this tradition since 1919 until today.

Throughout its history two clear directions can be identified : a solid leading place in the national library system and active participation in international library cooperation.[3]
