The dwellings and site plan of the 3-acre (1.2 ha) site are based on lengthy archeological excavations sponsored by the Dayton Society of Natural History, which owns and operates the site as an open-air museum.  Because of its archaeological value, the site was listed in 1974 on the National Register of Historic Places.  Since that time, as the many years of archaeological research at the site have led to important findings about the Fort Ancient culture, SunWatch Indian Village was designated in 1990 as a National Historic Landmark.[2]

In June 1995, Rev. Burt Palmer was appointed to begin a new United Methodist Church in Allen. By September of that year, three families were gathering to worship at the parsonage. The group grew, and by the end of that year, Sunday morning worship moved to Green Elementary School. Then, on September 22, 1996, Suncreek was officially constituted as a United Methodist Church. In early 1999, the church began to build on property at Suncreek and McDermott Drives.  This involved renovating a home that was on the site and adding additional rooms for a Sanctuary and classes.  In September 1999, the church left Green Elementary and began meeting in the new buildings. Rev. Kathleen Baskin-Ball was appointed Senior Pastor of Suncreek in June 2001. The following May, the church gathered for a Sunday morning worship service under a large tent to kickoff a capital campaign that would purchase land, renovate the existing building, erect a new building and Sanctuary, and add parking. One year later, the church broke ground on this phase of its development. The new building was completed in April 2004 and consecrated by Bishop William B. Oden on May 23, 2004. In early 2007, Rev. Kathleen Baskin-Ball was diagnosed with cancer. Despite the challenges of her illness and treatment, she continued to lead, serve and love the congregation until her death on December 2, 2008. One of Kathleen’s favorite ministerial duties was performing baptisms.  We desire to remember her with the beautiful Garden in our esplanade just south of the breezeway connecting the sanctuary with the children’s area. Rev. Dr. Thomas O.

</p>
      <p id="GL606_285_002" num_links="2">The strait stretches in a roughly northeast/southwest orientation, with a minimum width of 24 km (15 mi) at its northeastern end between Cape Tua on Sumatra and Cape Pujat on Java. It is very deep at its western end, but as it narrows to the east it becomes much shallower, with a depth of only 20 m (65 feet) in parts of the eastern end. It is notoriously difficult to navigate because of this shallowness, very strong tidal currents, sandbanks, and man-made obstructions such as oil platforms off the Java coast. It had been an important shipping route for centuries, especially during the period when the Dutch East India Company used it as the gateway to the <link wikipedia="Maluku_Islands" osm="9518636" type="relation">Spice Islands</link> of Indonesia (1602-1799).

      <p id="GL606_471_001" num_links="6">The town now called Sunnyvale was inhabited by various Native American tribes in the years before the European conquest of the Americas. It became under the rule of <link wikipedia="Spain" osm="148332300 1311341" type="node relation">Spain</link> in the 18th century, very close to the boundary of Spanish and <link wikipedia="France" osm="11980 2202162" type="relation relation">French</link> territory (although this boundary was carried upward a bit in 1819; see Adams-Onís Treaty.) During this time, the area was relatively underdeveloped. However, some settlers migrated to <link wikipedia="Texas" osm="316998356 114690" type="node relation">Texas</link> and would eventually settle in Sunnyvale. In 1821, the town became a possession of <link wikipedia="Mexico" osm="432425036 114686" type="node relation">Mexico</link> when Mexico received its independence from Spain. After the Texas Revolution, the area once again changed hands, under the Republic of Texas. This is when the town started to develop. During this time, settlers migrated to present-day Sunnyvale, naming the hamlet they founded Long Creek.1. In 1845 <link wikipedia="Texas" osm="316998356 114690" type="node relation">Texas</link> became a United States state. More settlers migrated to the area. In the 1860s, the town was briefly part of the Confederate States of America. As more people arrived, eventually three new towns sprang up in the area: New Hope, Tripp, and Hatterville. New Hope was the most prosperous of these. It had many shops and stores, a fair called Gala Days, and a newspaper, the New Hope News. It was neighboring <link wikipedia="Mesquite,_Texas" osm="151353292 6578217" type="node relation">Mesquite</link>'s biggest rival. This all ended in 1921, when a storm blew the town away 2. Many buildings were damaged and the prosperous days were over. From this year on to the 1950s, the four towns had no new developments, remaining stagnant.
In the year 1953, the hamlets of Hatterville, New Hope, Long Creek, and Tripp merged under the name Sunnyvale. The name was chosen in a contest from a local school. Today, there are many reminders of Sunnyvale's rich history, like the old New Hope School; the Tripp First Baptist Church, built in 1882; and many antique houses. The Long Creek Cemetery in southern Sunnyvale is over 150 years old, and the first recorded burial there is that of Leona Crownover Caldwell, dated October 2, 1855. There are also veterans from most major American wars, including the War of 1812, the Civil War (both Union and Confederate veterans), the World Wars, and others. Some of the oldest burials in the cemetery include James Truss and Priscilla Dulaney Truss, both born in 1799 2[permanent dead link].
In March 2012, Sunnyvale, Texas was named the whitest town in North Texas by D Magazine, and the power of that article was something that is still brought up today. The reason that Sunnyvale was named the whitest town in North Texas was based on an initial, U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyern study that deducted that out of 2,228 residents in Sunnyvale, TX, that only 16 of them were African American. [1]
On December 26, 2015 the town was struck by an EF-4 tornado causing extensive damage to the Plantation RV park, the tornado then grew and moved northeast into Garland and Rowlett killing 12 people and injuring dozens.
