Jed Dixon was the bridge's designer, and all work was performed by volunteers. The bridge was dedicated on 23 May 1993 but was burned by vandals on September 11 of that year. There was an immediate campaign to rebuild the bridge.  Twelve days after the destruction, the town council approved construction of the current bridge, which was dedicated on 5 November 1994.[2]:177–178

When it opened, the attraction required a C ticket.[6] The attraction originally opened with reddish brown leaves.

When the park opened its total surface area was 9000 m² (2.2 acres), but the park expanded and as of 2007, the park covers a surface area of 17'000 m² (or 4.2 acres). In 1989, the park possessed only 2 locomotives (one running on benzine and one on steam). As of 2007, the number of trains running on benzine has sextupled while the number of steam trains has increased to 9 trains. By March 31, 2007, the Park has had 2'126'000 visitors.

The park consists of 70 acres (28.3 ha) situated along the <link wikipedia="Sycamore_Shoals" osm="43564416" type="way">Sycamore Shoals</link> of the Watauga River, a National Historic Landmark where a series of events critical to the establishment of the states of Tennessee and <link wikipedia="Kentucky" osm="316959037 161655" type="node relation">Kentucky</link>, and the settlement of the Trans-Appalachian frontier in general, took place. Along with the historic shoals, the park includes a visitor center and museum, the reconstructed Fort Watauga, the Carter Mansion (at a satellite location in Elizabethton)[1] and Sabine Hill (also at a satellite location in Elizabethton).[2]
For over a thousand years before the arrival of European explorers, Sycamore Shoals and adjacent lands had been inhabited by Native Americans.[3] The first permanent European settlers arrived in 1770, and established the Watauga Association—one of the first written constitutional governments west of the <link wikipedia="Appalachian_Mountains" osm="4857603223" type="node">Appalachian Mountains</link>—in 1772. Richard Henderson and Daniel Boone negotiated the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals in 1775, which saw the sale of millions of acres of Cherokee lands in Kentucky and Tennessee and led to the building of the Wilderness Road. During the American Revolution, Sycamore Shoals was both the site of Fort Watauga, where part of a Cherokee invasion was thwarted in 1776, and the mustering ground for the Overmountain Men in 1780.[1][4]

It is frequently covered by the media in connection with its exposed situation in the <link wikipedia="North_Sea" osm="9051063" type="relation">North Sea</link> and its ongoing loss of land during storm tides. Since 1927, Sylt has been connected to the mainland by the <link wikipedia="Hindenburgdamm" osm="1159016" type="relation">Hindenburgdamm</link> causeway. In latter years, it has been a resort for the German jet set and tourists in search of occasional celebrity sightings.[citation needed]

The debate on this move had started in 2003 when a similar merger happened on <link wikipedia="Fehmarn" osm="382448" type="relation">Fehmarn</link>. However, local rivalries and desire for independence prevented progress for a time. It took the foundation of a citizens' movement Bürger für Sylt als Einheit to advance the plan. In separate referendums in 2008, Westerland (by a large majority) and Sylt-Ost (narrowly) agreed to the merger in May 2008. Rantum followed, but List, Kampen, Wenningstedt-Braderup and Hörnum remained aloof. In September 2008 the merger contract was signed.[3]
