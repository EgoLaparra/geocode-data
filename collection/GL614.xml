</p>
      <p id="GL614_003_002" num_links="2">Vyhoda's history started in the 19th century and was closely connected with the activity of Baron Leopold Popper von Podhragy. In 1873, Baron Leopold Popper von Podhragy opened a branch office in <link wikipedia="Patsykiv" osm="337580354" type="node">Pacykiv</link> (a small village near Vyhoda, which since 1966 is a part of Vyhoda) after buying the domain Vyhoda, which consisted of approximately 35,000 hectares. At that time, the Popper's firm (at the time the company was the largest timber industry venture worldwide) specialized in logging, processing and sale of wood. In the 1880s, the Baron installed the first 18-gang sawmill in the area close to Vyhoda, many more sawmills followed. The Baron opened the first ever College of the Timber Industry in Vyhoda which was unique worldwide and the first in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Svicha river was used by Popper's firm as the way to transport wood from mountains to sawmill. However, this way of wood transport was not perfect since the river was often blocked by the wood flooding living area. That is why in 1883 the railroad was built by Baron Popper von Podhragy from the district center <link wikipedia="Dolyna" osm="312269689 3607686" type="node relation">Dolyna</link> to Vyhoda. This year (1883) is the official data of Vyhoda's founding. At the end of the 19th century, Vyhoda became to develop drastically, and in 1895 there were water and steam sawmills, the plant of wood frames of musical instruments, mill, and railway station. In 1897, the chemical plant specialized on wood alteration was built by German Peter Wergan.
The Vyhoda's inhabitants took part in the First and the Second World War.

Due to the fact that ensuing post-glacial rebound surpassed concurrent sea-level rise, lake Vänern became a part of the Ancylus Lake that occupied the Baltic basin.[7] Vänern was connected to Ancylus Lake by a strait at Degerfors, Närke. Further uplift made lakes such as Vänern and Vättern become cut off from the Baltic.[7] As a result, there are still species remaining from the ice age not normally encountered in freshwater lakes, such as the amphipod Monoporeia affinis. A Viking ship was found on the lake's bottom on May 6, 2009.[8]

The structure was built in 1879-1886 after the city bought land in order to create a port for coal and other bulk goods. Rail freight and passenger traffic were routed through the Värtabanan line when the Värtan station was inaugurated in 1882. The port was widened and deepened gradually during the early 1900s, and in 1903 the nearby coal-fired Värtaverket plant was inaugurated.[1]  In 1904, a municipal building was added which served as the customs and port offices.

The cave has a wide entrance but narrows down in some places. An iron gate was installed at the first constriction in 1991 to preserve those of the delicate lava formations or speleothems which hadn't already been destroyed.

Preston used the main single expansion reciprocating steam engines, as well as many pumps and other hardware from her 1914 predecessor Swinomish. The Swinomish was built to replace the earlier Skagit, the first snagboat to work the rivers of the Puget Sound.

Originally licensed for daytime operations only, WTOL was granted authority for around-the-clock operations in 1939 and affiliated with NBC's Blue Network (later to become ABC Radio) shortly thereafter. Programming on WTOL, until the mid-1960s, was a full-service format of news, information, sports, ABC network programs and various types of music, including pop, country, jazz, and, by the early 1960s, some rock and roll. The station started broadcasting 24 hours a day in 1962 with the new format "Demand Radio 123". The format was very tightly controlled, and the announcers said very little, other than time and weather. there were scripted intros for songs. The playlist contained about 200 popular favorites of the 40s and 50s. The tight format wore out in less than two years. In 1964 WTOL became a personality driven full service facility, and played popular music, while avoiding "hard rock". You could hear the Beatles, and the Stones, but only songs like Yesterday, Michelle, and As Tears Go By. For many years, WTOL was a family of three broadcast stations which included <link wikipedia="WTOL" osm="357495645 357509658" type="node node">TV-11</link> and <link wikipedia="WIOT" osm="357509546" type="node">FM-104.7</link>.

However, the creation of additional NPR programming in the 1980s created the need for an additional NPR outlet in Cincinnati, at which time WVXU (then licensed to <link wikipedia="Xavier_University" osm="2271876" type="relation">Xavier University</link>) became a member of NPR.  While the two stations together provided most of the NPR programs available to a single market, the two NPR daily flagship newsmagazines aired separately; specifically, WVXU carried Morning Edition, while WGUC carried All Things Considered. With both stations now under the same licensee, program duplication, sometimes a problem in markets with more than one public radio station, could be eliminated. This means that WGUC broadcasts almost exclusively classical music, while WVXU carries news and information programming, including both NPR flagship newsmagazines.

The station was in existence from 1922 to 2000, and was the oldest surviving broadcast outlet in Chicago. It was a class A clear channel station, and could be heard, particularly at night, over most of the eastern United States. WMAQ was owned in its later years by CBS Radio, but for much of its life it was owned by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and later Westinghouse Broadcasting. The station's original owner was the Chicago Daily News newspaper, but its longest-running ownership was as an NBC Radio owned-and-operated station. Its transmitter was located in <link wikipedia="Bloomingdale,_Illinois" osm="153774581 125459" type="node relation">Bloomingdale, Illinois</link> just off Army Trail Road, with a 238-meter (780-foot) tower where it remains today, with the callsign still on the exterior facade.
