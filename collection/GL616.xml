From its wellspring the water flows for just under three metres on German soil, before crossing into Bohemia for almost a kilometre, where it is known as the Lesní Nába, and then flowing northwest, re-crossing the German border and reaching  Bärnau.
As a result of seasonal fluctuations in the water table and the increasing degradation of the wellspring, its water reaches the surface initially a few metres away from the actual spring, then further and further away as the year wears on and eventually appears on the Czech side of the border.
During the Cold War the spring was a very popular destination for walkers, even though it was next to the heavily guarded border. When collecting blueberries between the border posts, pickers were often closely watched by uniformed guards from both sides.

[and] holiness",  and who is specifically "chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles".[5] The doctrine of saints was articulated by Islamic scholars very early on in Muslim history,[6][7][5][8] and particular verses of the Quran and certain hadith were interpreted by early Muslim thinkers as "documentary evidence"[5] of the existence of saints. Graves of saints around the Muslim world became centers of pilgrimage — especially after 1200 CE — for masses of Muslims seeking their barakah (blessing).[9]

The ranch was built by James A. Walker, who first settled in the <link wikipedia="Boulder,_Colorado" osm="151932773 112298" type="node relation">Boulder</link> area in 1865. Walker and his family initially lived in a log cabin on the ranch, which was built in 1865. In 1881, Walker and his family built and moved to a new ranch house. Walker engaged in a number of business ventures on the ranch and leased parts of the ranch to other businessmen, and the enterprises which took place on the ranch represent many of the region's industries at the time. Walker mainly raised cattle and milled lumber on the property, and an English firm mined gold using a cyanide mill; payments from the latter operation allowed Walker to eliminate his debt and purchase additional land for the ranch. Of the remaining historic buildings on the ranch, eleven are from Walker's homestead and his ranching operations, fourteen were part of Walker's sawmill operations, and fourteen are related to the cyanide mill. The ranch also includes five archaeological sites; three of these are remnants of aboriginal settlement in the area and two of these are Arapahoe sites, including a site Walker may have shared with the Arapahoe when he first came to the area.[2]

The neighborhood developed quickly during the early 20th century after the establishment of the <link wikipedia="University_of_Washington" osm="5268488" type="relation">University of Washington</link> to the east. With trolley tracks laid through the neighborhood as early as 1907, Wallingford is a classic streetcar suburb, typified by its many 1920s era box houses and bungalows. Commercial development is primarily concentrated along 45th Street where a number of iconic structures stand including the neon "WALLINGFORD" sign, the Wallingford Center, and the original Dick's Drive-In. With its central location, numerous public amenities, including the world-renowned <link wikipedia="Gas_Works_Park" osm="1047789" type="relation">Gas Works Park</link>, and views of both the <link wikipedia="Olympic_Mountains" osm="684881007" type="way">Olympic</link> and <link wikipedia="Cascade_Range" osm="684881009" type="way">Cascade</link> mountains, Wallingford has long been home to many middle and upper-class families. While Wallingford is mostly residential in nature, the neighborhood's southern edge, along Lake Union, has historically been an industrial and commercial business strip. In recent years, numerous office buildings have been developed as an extension of the burgeoning business center in neighboring Fremont. In 2014 Brooks Sports moved its headquarters from <link wikipedia="Bothell,_Washington" osm="137907145 237656" type="node relation">Bothell</link> to a new six-story office building at the southwestern edge of Wallingford.

Generally the boundaries are considered as <link wikipedia="Washington_State_Route_99" osm="2855416" type="relation">Aurora Avenue</link> to the west, <link wikipedia="Interstate_5" osm="2329642" type="relation">Interstate 5</link> to the east, Lake Union to the south, and 50th Street to the north; however the western and northern boundaries are often debated.

The 1998 Neighborhood Plan defined the northern edge of the neighborhood as 60th Street, however the area north of 50th street is often associated with <link wikipedia="Green_Lake,_Seattle" osm="150939088" type="node">Green Lake</link> and sometimes considered part of the distinct neighborhood of Tangletown.[4]

Established in the 11th century as a motte-and-bailey design within an Anglo-Saxon burgh, it grew to become what historian Nicholas Brooks has described as "one of the most powerful royal castles of the 12th and 13th centuries".[1] Held for the Empress Matilda during the civil war years of the Anarchy, it survived multiple sieges and was never taken. Over the next two centuries it became a luxurious castle, used by royalty and their immediate family. After being abandoned as a royal residence by Henry VIII, the castle fell into decline. Refortified during the English Civil War, it was eventually slighted,  i.e. deliberately destroyed, after being captured by Parliamentary forces after a long siege. The site was subsequently left relatively undeveloped, and the limited remains of the castle walls and the considerable earthworks are now open to the public.
