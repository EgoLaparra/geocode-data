The countryside around Warin is composed of forests, lakes, and agricultural land given over to cereal production and animal husbandry of various kinds. The lakes are popular with canoeists, and swimmers, and also provide beautiful lakeshore frontage for the residential properties which skirt the two lakes situated immediately north and south of the town. The forests are ideal for nature-trail rambles, and are not too extensive to get easily lost, before one will encounter a forest trail to regain one's proper direction back to town.

      <p id="GL618_051_001" num_links="2">Warm Springs, originally named Bullochville (after the Bulloch family, the family of Martha Bulloch Roosevelt), first came to prominence in the 19th century as a spa town, because of its mineral springs which flow constantly at nearly 90 °F (32 °C). Residents of Georgia, particularly <link wikipedia="Savannah,_Georgia" osm="154392895 119867" type="node relation">Savannah</link>, began spending vacations at Bullochville in the late 18th century as a way to escape yellow fever, finding the number of warm springs in the vicinity of Bullochville very attractive. In the late 19th century traveling to the warm springs was attractive as a way to get away from <link wikipedia="Atlanta" osm="153843609 119557" type="node relation">Atlanta</link>.[clarification needed]  Traveling by railroad to Durand, they would then go to Bullochville. One of the places benefiting from this was the Meriwether Inn. Once the automobile became popular in the early 20th century, the tourists began going elsewhere, starting the decline of the Meriwether Inn.[4][5]

The railway station is the westernmost terminus of the Warsaw Cross-City Line. It serves trains from PKP Intercity, Przewozy Regionalne, Koleje Mazowieckie, Szybka Kolej Miejska and Warszawska Kolej Dojazdowa as well as international trains passing through Warsaw. Despite being one of the main railway stations in Warsaw, since its construction in 1936 there has been limited development of the station.

</p>
      <p id="GL618_348_002" num_links="4">The station was built as part of the development of the Warsaw Railway Junction that was begun in 1919. Warszawa Zachodnia was opened in 1936 as the most westerly station on the Warsaw Cross-City Line. However, later efforts went into developing the stations in the center of Warsaw. It was not until the 1970s that an underpass was built to connect the platforms and a station building was built on the northern side. In 1975, a platform for Warszawska Kolej Dojazdowa trains was added. In 1980, the south side of the station was developed, with a road underpass being built to connect <link wikipedia="Wola" osm="361071224 2531982" type="node relation">Wola</link> and <link wikipedia="Ochota" osm="2534033" type="relation">Ochota</link> and the long-distance bus station added. The Warszawa Wola railway station, built in the 1980s just 250 m (820 ft) away from Warszawa Zachodnia, on 20 May 2012 was incorporated to Warszawa Zachodnia station as Platform 8, and continues handling trains to <link wikipedia="Nasielsk" osm="31603215 2589318" type="node relation">Nasielsk</link>, Ciechanów and Działdowo.

The tower stands on the territory of the town of Lübbecke.
The stone tower was built in 1857 by the barons (Freiherrn) of Bussche-Münch from Benkhausen and was completely renovated in 1996. The tower was erected in response to the increasing gymnastics and hiking movement in Germany at that time.
During the Nazi era and the <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">Second World War</link> the tower acted for a time as a training area for the Hitler Youth as well as an observation point, for which purpose it had been increased in height by the addition of a wooden superstructure.
In 1986 a radio competition took place at the Wartturm. In the early to mid-1980s a very high transmission mast stood next to the tower, that was significantly higher than the tower itself and, unlike the Wartturm, could be clearly seen from Lübbecke.
The uninformed often say that the tower is linked to the medieval castle of <link wikipedia="Reineberg" osm="307637258 440776549" type="node node">Reineberg</link> because of its castle-like appearance but are then often surprised to find that it is a product of the Modern Age.[1]

The original wooden motte-and-bailey castle was rebuilt in stone during the 12th century. During the Hundred Years War, the facade opposite the town was refortified, resulting in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th-century military architecture. It was used as a stronghold until the early 17th century, when it was granted to Sir Fulke Greville by James I in 1604. Greville converted it to a country house and it was owned by the Greville family, who became Earls of Warwick in 1759, until 1978 when it was bought by the Tussauds Group.

It is found at an elevation of 1,316 feet (401 m).[2] The lake occupies three distinct basins. A public access is co-located at the Clinton Converse DNR Forestry Campground at the south end of the eastern basin. Based on 2009 data, development is considered moderate, with 17.2 homes/cabins per shoreline mile. The maximum depth is 111 feet (34 m) and about 48% of the lake is 15 feet (4.6 m) deep or less. Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, boulders and muck are also present. The aquatic plant community is quite diverse and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations. Emergent plants such as bulrush are common along much of the shoreline, however just as common are numerous gaps in these beds along shorelines with developed lots. The remaining emergent plants should be protected as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and providing essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species. Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.
