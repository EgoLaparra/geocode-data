It is one of the earliest settlements in Kentucky and also one of the earliest American settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains. It played a significant role in the lead-up to the Civil War, producing two civil war generals (one Union and one Confederate) and an escaped slave whose legal case established Canada as a safe haven for escaping slaves. It also provided the site where Harriet Beecher Stowe witnessed a slave auction.  It has since been annexed by Maysville, and is sometimes now referred to as Old Washington. The community is in Area 606 served by the 759 exchange.

The captain was awarded some land in 1842 as settlement of a lawsuit with the British Consul Richard Charlton. The captain continued to take voyages to raise money for the construction of a house. In 1846 he sailed for China on the Brig William Neilson, intending to purchase Chinese-made furniture for the house, which was nearing completion. The ship was lost at sea, along with the American Agent George Brown, and Mary Dominis became a widow.[2] She rented out a suite of rooms to support herself and young John Owen. One of the first boarders was Anthony Ten Eyck, an American Commissioner to the islands appointed by President <link wikipedia="James_K._Polk" osm="2511683" type="relation">James K.

Just before dawn on November 27, 1868, the village was attacked by the 7th U.S. Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Custer.  In the Battle of Washita, the Cheyenne suffered large numbers of casualties.  The strike was hailed at the time by the military and many civilians as a significant victory aimed at reducing Indian raids on frontier settlements as it forced the Cheyenne back to the reservation set aside for them.  The site is a small portion of a large area that was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965,[2][3] and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.  The landmarked area encompasses the entire battlefield, which extends for some 6 miles (9.7 km) through the city of Cheyenne.[3]

While Whisman was out hunting, the two came upon him, removed his gun, looked at it, and handed it back while saying, "Wash-tay, Wash-tay," meaning good. Changing the pronunciation slightly, Whisman decided he would call the town Washta.[4]

American sent representatives to Waterloo to present to the Chamber of Commerce and a straw poll of area businesses showed local companies favored service to Chicago over Minneapolis. American said they plan to only need the EAS subsidy for two years, when they believe that service will be self-sustaining. The Waterloo city council sent a recommendation to the DOT that American be awarded the contract and on December 8 DOT awarded American Eagle the contract. The regional airline affiliate of American Airlines initially operated flights twice daily.[2]  American Eagle previously served Waterloo with ATR-42 and Saab 340 turboprop flights to Chicago during the 1990s.[3][4]

Watkins Glen was the northern terminus of the <link wikipedia="Chemung_Canal" osm="55947716" type="way">Chemung Canal</link>, started in 1830 and completed in 1833, connecting <link wikipedia="Seneca_Lake_(New_York)" osm="4500007" type="relation">Seneca Lake</link> to the <link wikipedia="Chemung_River" osm="6658629" type="relation">Chemung River</link>. Catharine Creek, flowing into the lake through the village, was used to help create the canal. The village was incorporated in 1842 as Salubria, then Jefferson, but was renamed Watkins after Dr. Samuel Watkins, the founder, for his contributions to the community. The current name Watkins Glen was adopted in 1926.

The park's lower part is near the village, while the upper part is open woodland.  It was opened to the public in 1863 and was privately run as a tourist resort until 1906, when it was purchased by New York State.[1][2] Initially known as Watkins Glen State Reservation, the park was first managed by the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society before being turned over to full state control in 1911.[1] Since 1924, it has been managed by the Finger Lakes Region of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.[3]
