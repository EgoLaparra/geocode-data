It is a Greek Revival style chapel located in a quarter acre fenced-in plot, which also includes a graveyard, within Mount Pleasant Park in northeast Baltimore. The structure is a small, mid-19th-century country church, built of stone, covered with stucco, painted white, and has a gable roof.  The interior features frescoes on the walls and ceiling, attributed by tradition to the Italian-American painter Constantino Brumidi. The frescoes are trompe l’oeil paintings of classical architectural detailing, including pilasters, panels, coffering, and ornaments. It has remained completely unaltered since its construction in 1853.[2]  It was built as a Methodist chapel by the Taylor family on their Mt. Pleasant plantation.  In 1925 the City of Baltimore purchased the land surrounding the chapel and burial grounds for use as a public golf course.  The site of the chapel and burial grounds was left to a self-perpetuating board of trustees.  Taylor's Chapel is considered the mother church of St. John's United Methodist Church of Hamilton.[3]

The unofficial name used by the national caving association is Aurora. The caves are geologically young (estimated 12,000 years)[1] and hence there is only one tiny stalactite.

The theatre opened on 23 March 1873 and featured the company of actor Manuel Catalina.[1] A comedy playhouse, it went through difficult times in its early days due to its relative distance from the then city center and the high ticket price. The Apolo and the Felipe theatres were the most important venues for the género chico, a phenomenon which debuted in Madrid and featured one-act performances.[2] The Apolo closed its doors on 30 June 1929 after it was purchased by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, which demolished the theatre in order to construct its Madrid headquarters.

Privately owned theatres with limited seating capacity had existed in the city for many years, but the arrival of Cardinal Spinelli, the new papal envoy, in 1786 spurred the  construction of a new public theatre under the architects Cosimo Morelli and Antonio Foschini.  However, their disagreements led to conflicting design concepts regarding the elliptical shape of the auditorium which were resolved through compromise.  The theatre was finally ready for its inaugural presentation of Portogallo’s Gli Orazi e i Curiazi on 2 September 1798.

A proposal to the Austrian Chancery from Giovanni Matteo Tommasini to build a private theatre had existed since 1795 and, in June 1798, a contract was drawn up whereby annual funding would come from the municipality and Tommasini would hold the rights to several boxes and the rights to sell others.

After the exposition the theatre had a mixed history. It suffered damage from fire and flood. At times it was closed and at times was partially restored and reopened. The building has been used as a hospital and as a trade show venue. Following its most recent renovation the theatre has become one of Seville's most important centres for cultural events.

He moved to the nearby city of Mayaguez where he established himself as one of the pioneers of the industry of cinematography in the island of Puerto Rico, introducing this new form of Visual Art early in the beginning of the 20th century by showing silent films throughout the nearby towns and becoming the exclusive distributor for 'Nicholas Power Co.' movie projectors throughout the Caribbean islands.

The history of educational facilities in <link wikipedia="Tecumseh,_Michigan" osm="135111" type="relation">Tecumseh, Michigan</link> began in the winter of 1824 when the founders of the city of Tecumseh, the Evans Family and Brown Family, constructed a schoolhouse made of tamarack poles to house their children. In 1826, a larger, eighteen feet by twenty feet, privately funded school house was built on the public square on Maumee Street. Until 1832 this was the only village school in <link wikipedia="Lenawee_County,_Michigan" osm="1801750" type="relation">Lenawee County</link>; in that year, another private school was established on the ridge beyond Evans Creek until being moved to the county courthouse in 1836.
