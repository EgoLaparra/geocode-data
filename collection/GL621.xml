The continental divide passes through the state, meaning there is drainage toward both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Most of the drainage toward the Gulf is represented by the Papaloapan and Coatzacoalcos Rivers and their tributaries such as the Grande and Salado Rivers. Three rivers account for most of the water headed for the Pacific: the Atoyac River, Mixteco River, and the Tehuantepec River, with their tributaries.[1]

The site of the city, palace and citadel together measure over 0.45 km2 (110 acres).[1] The name Karmir Blur translates to "Red Hill" because of the hill's reddish hue. It became this color after the city was set on fire and the upper walls which were made of tuff fell and crumbled because of the heat. After the tuff was heated by the fire, it took on a more intense red color and therefore the hill became red. The lower portions of the walls were left standing after the fire since they were built with a stronger stone. Teishebaini is situated at a height of 901 metres (2,956 ft).[2]

Despite being positioned at the top of a cliff, the wooden structure was not high enough. In 1882, it was therefore repositioned on a round base. The owner, Peter Mikkelsen, took advantage of the move to replace the old sails with new ones complete with adjustable flaps. Unlike most post mills, the sails rotate anticlockwise. Mikkelsen also enlarged the mill, both in height and depth. His son operated the mill until 1941 when Foreningen Bornholm took it over to ensure its upkeep. By 2000, the mill was no longer able to function properly as a result of trees and buildings in the surroundings. In 2006, it was therefore decided it should be moved to Landbrugsmuseet Melstedgård where it was inaugurated in 2009.[2][1]

Telavi began to transform into a fairly important and large political and administrative center in the 8th century. Interesting information on Telavi is provided in the records by an Arab geographer, Al-Muqaddasi of the 10th century, who mentions Telavi along with such important cities of that time's Caucasus as <link wikipedia="Tbilisi" osm="1614277087 1996871" type="node relation">Tbilisi</link>, Shamkhor, <link wikipedia="Ganja,_Azerbaijan" osm="183345861 3764556" type="node relation">Ganja</link>, <link wikipedia="Shamakhi" osm="226791840" type="node">Shemakha</link> and Shirvan.

The towers are used for both analog and digital television broadcasts, plus the transmission of KSTC channel 45 (owned by the same company as KSTP) and WUCW channel 23.  Some area radio stations also use the facility.  The towers were initially built in the 1970s, and were replacements for a single "candelabra" style tower which collapsed just prior to completion in 1971, killing six workers on the tower and one on the ground.[1]

The towers were upgraded at the turn of the century to allow the addition of digital TV transmitters to meet <link wikipedia="Federal_Communications_Commission" osm="84599909" type="way">Federal Communications Commission</link> requirements.  Because each antenna assembly weighs many tons, the towers had to be strengthened.

In 1812, after the Treaty of Bucharest, Bessarabia was occupied by the Russian Empire, and an intense process of russification of the native population followed. In 1918, as a result of the fall of the Russian Empire, Bessarabia was united with Romania, and the Romanian government enacted a land reform. Telenești became the center of a plasă of Orhei County, along with 45 villages.

The first gold mining claim was made in the mountains above Telluride in 1875, and early settlement of what is now Telluride followed. The town itself was founded in 1878 as "Columbia", but due to confusion with a California town of the same name, was renamed Telluride in 1887 for the gold telluride minerals found in other parts of Colorado. These telluride minerals were never found near Telluride, but the area's mines for some years provided zinc, lead, copper, silver, and other gold ores.

The earliest known inhabitands of the area were the Mazahua. It was originally called "Ñiñi Mbate" which probably means 'place of the small plain' but possibly 'place of the first man'. This area was conquered by the Aztecs before the 16th century, and its last Aztec governor was named Ocoyotzen.  When the Spanish invaded, the Mazahuas and the Otomis of this area united with the Aztecs to fight them. However, after the Spanish victory, Hernán Cortés distributed this area, along with <link wikipedia="Metepec" osm="376221384 614481541" type="way way">Metepec</link> to Francisco de Villegas in 1540. In 1535, the Franciscans began evangelization here, establishing churches and renaming the area, San Miguel Temascalcingo. Through the 18th century, haciendas here grew to supply grain to mining areas like <link wikipedia="Tlalpujahua" osm="3006000330" type="node">Tlalpujahua</link> and El Oro. Because of a history of mistreatment by colonial authorities, the residents here sided early with Hidalgo when the Mexican War of Independence broke out in 1810. Shortly after the end of the war, the State of Mexico was created in 1824 and the municipality of Temascalcingo in 1825, with San Miguel Temascalcingo as the seat. This area was the scene of a destructive earthquake in 1912. As the birthplace of the painter José María Velasco Gómez, the town changed its name to Temascalcingo de José María Velasco July 14, 1945 by decree.  However, it is still commonly referred to simply as "Temascalcingo". In 1988, a group of residents from Tepeolulco, a community under Temascalcingo's jurisdiction, took over the municipal hall to protest water supplies and civil rights violations.[1]

It was built towards the middle of the sixth century BC on top of the foundations of a more ancient building.[4] It is the best conserved of the temples of Selinus but its present appearance is the result of anastylosis (reconstruction using original material) performed—controversially—in 1959, by the Italian archaeologist Jole Bovio Marconi.

Eventually, the building fell into disuse by the state other than storage space, and so it was purchased by the Catholic Diocese of Helena, which owns it today and uses it to house their administrative offices.  While the Jewish communities of Montana have always been small, they have become more active and visible in recent decades.

</p>
      <p id="GL621_486_002" num_links="3">The temple's construction took place during the 1st century AD, having been vowed by the Roman Senate shortly after the death of the emperor in AD 14. Ancient sources disagree on whether it was constructed by Augustus' successor Tiberius and Augustus' widow Livia or by Tiberius alone.[4] It was not until after the death of Tiberius in 37 that the temple was finally completed and dedicated by his successor Caligula. Some scholars have suggested that the delays in completing the temple indicated that Tiberius had little regard for the honours of his predecessor. Others have argued the opposite case, pointing to evidence that Tiberius made his last journey from his villa on <link wikipedia="Capri" osm="2675353" type="relation">Capri</link> with the intention of entering Rome and dedicating the temple. However, the emperor died at <link wikipedia="Miseno" osm="4210998162" type="node">Misenum</link> on the <link wikipedia="Gulf_of_Naples" osm="8222502" type="relation">Bay of Naples</link> before he could set off for the capital.
