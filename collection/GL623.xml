Similar to East Coast Park and <link wikipedia="Pasir_Ris_Park" osm="8752029" type="relation">Pasir Ris Park</link>, West Coast Park was developed on a piece of reclaimed land. The park was completed in 1979. Another reclamation project was later undertaken by PSA Singapore in the 1980s for port development. This latter project mostly removed access to the coastline, surrounded most of the park by high-traffic roads, and spoilt the ambience by giant cranes and other structures built for the adjacent container terminal. Subsequently, visitorship declined considerably. National Parks Board (NParks) then introduced a redevelopment project for West Coast Park in 1998 to remediate the problem. By 2000, Phase 1 development that covers the western portion of the park was completed. The park was revitalized with an improvement in infrastructure, along with the addition of facilities and features.[1]

Utilizing the central pier from the previous incarnation, despite the Town lattice being able to withstand the weight and single span, the bridge has two spans. The later addition of queen trusses and supports gives the bridge an unusual appearance. Modernization of the bridge in 1968 and 1973 has continued to let the bridge handle traffic. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

Half of Deer Township was used to create <link wikipedia="Indiana_Township,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania" osm="6885847" type="relation">Indiana Township</link> in 1805.

West Deer also annexed land along it southern border from Indiana Township in this exchange.[4] Historically, much of West Deer's economy has been based on farming and coal mining. Many coal towns such as Curtisville, Bairdford, and Russellton were dominant forces in the industry. In recent years, significant suburban growth has occurred in the southwestern and central portions of the township, while other portions have remained rural.

Mother's Beach, Middle Beach or Rocky Beach, and Gooch's Beach or Long Beach. Separate from Kennebunk Beach is secluded Parson's Beach, a quiet alternative to the summer crowds. Note there is some local controversy regarding the "Mother's Beach" moniker, (nickname). According to many local residents, the smaller of the three main beaches - at the intersection of Beach Ave and Ridge Ave - is officially Kennebunk Beach or, alternatively, Boothby Beach. The term Boothby beach was from the mid-1730s when a Mabel Littlefield married Richard Boothby and settled on land near what came to be known as Boothby Beach.The information about the Boothbys was taken from "Old News From Southern Maine" article on Mable and Richard Boothby, by Sharon Cummins. Many natives today may not remember it being called Boothby Beach and over the years the beach came to be known as Kennebunk Beach or Mothers Beach. Older residents also recall the name Dipsy Bath Beach, a reference to the baths once located there.  The term Mother's Beach didn't come into widespread use until the mid '80s; Although other native residents will dispute that date and say they remember it being called "Mothers Beach" as far back as the late 1950s. The name likely evolved due to its small size and generally calmer water, due to the rocks under and above the ocean, thus making it a natural made harbor of refuge that is safer for swimming and which makes it popular with mothers keeping a watchful eye on their progeny, (children).  The name is clearly descriptive rather than official, in spite of the recent installation of road signs pointing the way to "Mother's Beach".[5] Contradicting the above beach naming is the Town's website listing "Permits are valid for Gooch’s Beach, Kennebunk Beach (Middle Beach) and Mother’s Beach."[6] Additionally without public parking access both Libbys and Crescent beaches are in Kennebunk between Parson's beach and Mother's beach.
