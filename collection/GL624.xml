The tower and tank were built in 1928 as part of the village's new water system, which had been approved the previous year. The water system was introduced both as a response to several fires which had plagued the village and as an effort to bring modern technology and progress, among other civic concerns. The water tower consists of a steel tank with a hemispherical bottom supported by a steel trestle; the structure is 136.5 feet (41.6 m) tall. The ground storage tank, located at the base of the tower, is made of redwood and holds 30,000 US gallons (110,000 l; 25,000 imp gal) of water.[2]

      <p id="GL624_095_002" num_links="5">The village of West Wemyss began as a settlement around the site of Wemyss Castle which developed into a centre for the salt industry in the area.[1][4] A harbour was later built in 1621 by the Wemyss family for the use of coal exportation from the pits on the lands of their estate.[3] The harbour would become a major export point for coal by the late 17th century.[3] The ships brought back imports of wood, iron and flax from the <link wikipedia="Baltic_states" osm="4857459" type="relation">Baltic Countries</link>.[3] A wet dock was added for the increased demand of the coal in the 1870s.[3] Towards the latter stages of the 19th century, the village found itself surrounded by several mines - such as the Michael Pit in nearby <link wikipedia="East_Wemyss" osm="29343057" type="node">East Wemyss</link>.[5] The industry, which saw trade with <link wikipedia="England" osm="58447" type="relation">England</link> and The Low Countries, started to struggle once the new docks were opened in <link wikipedia="Methil" osm="529117977" type="node">Methil</link> further along the Fife coast. Gradually, the demand for the harbour began to fall and it went into decline.[5] The harbour has since been filled in and part of the old village restored,[3] becoming a conservation area with several attractive buildings.[5] William Angus Knight, Professor of Moral Philosophy at <link wikipedia="University_of_St_Andrews" osm="3504913908" type="node">St Andrews University</link>, editor and biographer of William Wordsworth, lived here as a child from 1844.

All five communities decided to retain the institutes. Some members of the Westchester County Board of Supervisors objected to taking on the management of the New York Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences, but community organizations, such as women's clubs, business men's leagues, and civic associations, voiced support. Some even pledged scholarships. A deal was reached so that the financial burden would be shared equally between the state, county, and the student body, with each contributing one-third towards the school's operating costs.[6] On August 12, 1953, Westchester County announced that the Institute would be replaced with Westchester Community College beginning September 1, 1953.[7]

Around 1997, the South Course was reconstructed with longer tees, new sand and grass bunkers, water hazards, and some new greens. The South Course is now more competitive with the West Course to accommodate low handicap golfers.

It was founded in 1973[1] by eight artists (Martin Bartlett, Mo van Nostrand, Kate Craig, Henry Greenhow, Glenn Lewis, Eric Metcalfe, Michael Morris, Vincent Trasov
[2]) who wanted to create a space for the exploration and creation of new art forms. After they purchased the former Knights of Pythias lodge hall located in Mount Pleasant, Vancouver,[3] it quickly became a centre for poets, dancers, musicians and visual artists interested in exploration and interdisciplinary practices.[4] Many of the Western Front's early works reflect this interdisciplinary ethos with early influences of Duchampian and Fluxus-based investigations into mail art, telecommunications art, live electronic music, video and performance art. Western Front also supported a number of political and activist projects - in one of their most famous performance pieces, founding member Vincent Trasov adopted the personality of Mr. Peanut, gave a number of performances and in 1974 ran for mayor of Vancouver. Mr. Peanut was so highly regarded that he was picked by The Vancouver Sun as one of the province's 100 most influential people as the end of the millennium approached in 1999.[5] As a focal point of experimental art practice through the 1970s and 1980s, the Western Front, in connection with other centres like it, played a major role in the development of electronic and networked art forms in a national and international context.[6][7]

The museum is often considered to have one of the most complete and historic collections of equipment and materials from a single railroad family. The holdings also include extensive corporate records and images, as well as personal collections from those who worked for the Western Pacific. 
The WPRM is a "hands-on" museum that allows visitors to board and explore locomotives and cars in their collection.[3]
Among the significant pieces in the WPRM collection are Western Pacific 805-A, an FP7 model passenger locomotive that pulled the California Zephyr;[10] Southern Pacific EMD GP9 #2873, nicknamed "the Kodachrome" by the volunteers, due to it being painted with the Kodachrome scheme from the failed Santa Fe–Southern Pacific merger; WP 2001, the first GP20 model locomotive (an early turbocharged Diesel);[11] WP 501, an early switch engine and the first Diesel purchased by the Western Pacific;[12] Western Pacific 0-6-0 steam locomotive 165, an oil burning switch engine built by ALCO in 1919;[5] WP 37, a 200-ton rail-mounted crane, two track clearing snowplows (one wedge type and one rotary); and several rare, early 20th century freight cars.

It acquired the original 30 acres (120,000 m2) of land.[1] Their goal was to save heritage buildings that were in danger of being destroyed and also to create a hands-on educational facility to teach pioneer life. Glenn Kilmer's father had been a builder and owner of Kilmer Lumber Company in Aylmer Ontario (subsequently sold to Beaver Lumber Co). Golden Macdonnell was a science teacher who had a keen interest in the history of Ontario. Both men were able to reconstruct the donated buildings which arrived at Westfield.

The present north building was built in 1892 and the present south building was built in 1912.  An access tunnel connects the two platforms and, like Cranford, there are historic photographs of Westfield displayed in the tunnel.

The Westfjords are very mountainous; the coastline is heavily indented by dozens of fjords surrounded by steep hills. These indentations make roads very circuitous and communications by land difficult. In addition many of the roads are closed by ice and snow for several months of the year. The Vestfjarðagöng road tunnel from 1996 has improved that situation.

      <p id="GL624_494_002" num_links="2">The park land is the former estate of George Westinghouse, an <link wikipedia="United_States" osm="424317935 148838" type="node relation">American</link> entrepreneur and engineer, and his wife Marguerite.  With an area of about 10 acres, it was the site of his mansion known as Solitude.  At this house, Westinghouse worked with his engineers, including <link wikipedia="Nikola_Tesla" osm="1764403580 4007814801 5051738293" type="node node node">Nikola Tesla</link>, and entertained notable people of the day, including scientist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), and congressman and later president William McKinley.[1]  Close by was another building, a carriage house, that housed his private laboratory in the basement. There, he developed some of his residential electric lighting technology, installing a generator and running cables to the main house, with wires that were left exposed on the interior walls, so as not to cut into the woodwork.[2]  Also there, Westinghouse invented methods to control and transmit natural gas for both industrial and residential consumers. In the winter of 1883/1884, seeking a source of natural gas in his own "back yard," Westinghouse ordered drilling on his estate.  When gas was struck on May 22, 1884, a blowout resulted in the uncontrolled release of gas for about a week.  Westinghouse devised a way to cap the well.  An illumination test was conducted by igniting the gas jet at the top of a tall pipe.  It initially produced a 100-foot flame that illuminated a mile-wide area to a brightness sufficient to read a newspaper.[2]  This well was designated as "Westinghouse Well No. 1" or "Old No. 1" to distinguish it from several other wells that were drilled in the area.[3]  Eventually, several natural gas derricks towered above the estate's Victorian gardens.[4]   In modern times there is no above-ground trace left of these derricks.
