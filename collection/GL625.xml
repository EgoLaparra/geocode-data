Abbot Leo also expressed the hope that the Priory would become a Community in its own right in the movement of monastic renewal.[2] Today, the community is an Independent or Conventual Priory. 
At the beginning, Abbot Leo considered locating the Priory in Pennsylvania or a few other places, but the presence of other religious houses in those places required that he look elsewhere. With the help of friendly Benedictine Oblates (Dr. Leon and Dorothea Smith) from his time in Keyport, New Jersey, he located a suitable site in the Green Mountains of Vermont.[2]
The original building was an old abandoned farmhouse with an attached barn, a few miles from the village of Weston. The attached barn had been partially burned and was renovated to become the chapel. Abbot Leo engaged Architects and Builders, a Weston group to renovate the barn-chapel. The main house became the monastery kitchen, dining room, library, and tiny gift shop on the ground floor. Four small separate rooms and the Prior's room occupied the second floor.  A dilapidated chicken house  behind the main house was renovated to become classroom, recreation room and dormitory for novices.  This latter building was heated by a small wood stove and fireplace, and had indoor plumbing.[3]

The castle was besieged and destroyed around 1350 after the Rabenswaldes became robber knights during the Thuringian Counts' War. It is possible that settlements around the castle were also attacked and destroyed at the time the castle was slighted.

Over the course of about 300 years, the Norse settled in Wexford, intermarried with the local population and gradually converted to Christianity. They forged temporary alliances with Irish kings, sometimes fighting with other Norse towns; at other times, such as in 933 and 1161 they were attacked by the Irish. The Norse remained in control until 1169 AD when Wexford was attacked by a superior force of Norman and Irish soldiers. There was a short battle after which the Hiberno-Norse withdrew within the walls leaving their ships unprotected. These were set on fire by the attackers - this may have been the origin of the Wexford Town crest, the three burning ships.

It is the home of Wexford GAA's Gaelic football and hurling teams. After a recent development the ground has a capacity of about 25,000.
It is located in the Clonard area on the outskirts of Wexford Town, and although the ground does not have floodlights it regularly hosts evening matches during the brighter summer months. In 2015 a local technology company, Innovate Business Technology, signed a deal for the naming rights to the stadium. The new name unveiled was Innovate Wexford Park.

As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.[5] Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) or above 80 °F (27 °C).[5] During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.[6] Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.[6]
