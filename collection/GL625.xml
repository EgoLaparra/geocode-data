Originally located on the corner of 2nd and Putnam, the two-story Georgian style home was constructed for Frederick and Rosa Linsell in 1904, by architect John C. Stahl at a cost of $9,000. The Linsells lived there for 10 years before selling it. After serving as a home for two more families, the building was bought by the Detroit Board of Education in the 1930s. In 1939 the building became the Women’s Study Building for the university. It was the only building of 16 on its block that survived the expansion of Wayne State’s campus in the mid 1900s. In 1956 the Board of Education donated the Linsell House to the university and it became the office for the School of Business, and later the Biology Department. In 1987 the house was restored and turned into the Dean’s Office for the College of Fine Performing and Communication Arts. The thirteen-room house is now located at 5104 Gullen Mall, in the middle of the Wayne State campus.

Also, the trough in front of the tomb and the nearby cistern, described by proponents of the Garden Tomb as part of the tomb's sealing system and as the surrounding garden's source of water, respectively, have both been archaeologically dated to the Crusader period (12th-13th century).[2] The organisation maintaining the Garden Tomb refrains from claiming that this is the authentic tomb of Jesus, while pointing out the similarities with the site described in the Bible, and the fact that the Garden Tomb better preserves its ancient outlook than the more traditional, but architecturally altered and time-damaged tomb from the mostly crowded <link wikipedia="Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre" osm="612045225" type="way">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</link>; for all of these reasons, they suggest that the Garden Tomb is more evocative of the events described in the Gospels.[3]

It was first established at Hatherop in 1222 by William Longspee, Earl of Salisbury. The monks disliked the location, and on Longspee's death in 1226 they petitioned his countess for a new site to achieve greater solitude. She gave them her manors of Hinton Charterhouse and Norton St Philip and the new house was consecrated at Hinton Charterhouse in May 1232. A licence to sell alcohol at The George is claimed from 1397, which may have been a local licence from the Prior of Hinton Priory as Governmental licences for alehouses were only introduced in 1552.[5]

The Academy enrolls approximately 400 students in grades nine through twelve, 70% of whom are boarders. The school was established in 1763 and is the oldest continuously operating independent boarding school in the United States.[4]

</p>
      <p id="GL625_235_002" num_links="3">The school was founded two years after the death of William Dummer, who funded it in his will. Dummer had been lieutenant governor and acting governor of Massachusetts for many years, and led the colony through a difficult period in the earlier 18th century: fighting off forays by French and Indians during what became known as Dummer's War in the 1720s. He also served as an early overseer of Harvard College. He was from a prominent colonial family with his brother Jeremiah Dummer having been a principal founding benefactor of the College of New Haven which later became <link wikipedia="Yale_University" osm="3861723" type="relation">Yale University</link>. As the <link wikipedia="Boston_Latin_School" osm="228877766" type="way">Boston Latin School</link> only accepted students from the city of Boston, the need arose for schools in more outlying areas to prepare students for college—the only ones existing at that time in New England being Harvard and Yale; Brown and <link wikipedia="Dartmouth_College" osm="251899405" type="node">Dartmouth</link> were founded a few years afterward. In that context, the Dummer Charity School or Dummer Grammar School commenced operation in 1763 pursuant to the will of Governor Dummer with Samuel Moody as its first headmaster. In 1782, the Dummer school was officially incorporated as the Dummer Academy,[5] whose graduates in this era comprised approximately 25% of the undergraduate student body at Harvard.  Most children in this era were home-schooled with pre-college education ending around the age of 14, with youths thereafter going on to college or entering the workforce. Thus most college freshmen tended to be the age of high school freshmen today.

The entrance from the street is through iron gates under a pointed stone arch.

Construction began in 1794 [2] and the local author and artist Fred Hando records that the building "was completed within two years".[3] The building was sited to take advantage of the views and the Monmouth antiquarian and publisher Charles Heath recorded in his 1807 history; Descriptive Account of the Kymin Pavilion and Beaulieu Grove with their various views; also a description of the Naval Temple that ten counties could be seen from the Roundhouse; (<link wikipedia="Gloucestershire" osm="85103 2700308" type="relation relation">Gloucestershire</link>, <link wikipedia="Monmouthshire" osm="358021" type="relation">Monmouthshire</link>, Glamorganshire, Breconshire, Montgomeryshire, <link wikipedia="Worcestershire" osm="57581" type="relation">Worcestershire</link>, <link wikipedia="Herefordshire" osm="10187" type="relation">Herefordshire</link>, Radnorshire, <link wikipedia="Shropshire" osm="57511" type="relation">Shropshire</link> and <link wikipedia="Somerset" osm="3125930" type="relation">Somerset</link>).[1] A telescope by Peter Dollond was fitted in the upper room and Heath detailed a large number of the sights that could be viewed from the five windows.[4].

It is the oldest house in Washington (although not originally built there) and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1969.  The house was built in <link wikipedia="Danvers,_Massachusetts" osm="158811965 2355159" type="node relation">Danvers, Massachusetts</link> in 1754 as a grand summer home for Robert "King" Hooper, a leading shipowner and merchant in Marblehead, Massachusetts, who sided with the Tories before the Revolutionary War, and lent the house for four months to Thomas Gage, the reviled British Governor.  Hooper lost the house to creditors. After passing through several other owners, including one who used it as a boardinghouse, it was bought in 1860 by Francis Peabody Jr., who restored and added to it. It was bought in 1933 by antiques dealers Israel Sack and Leon David, who sold the paneled drawing room to a Kansas City museum.  The remainder of the house was sold for about $13,000 to George and Miriam Morris, who were seeking a period house to showcase their collection of early American furniture.  The Morrises had the house  dismantled and shipped to Washington, with the pieces numbered, in six railroad boxcars.  Under the direction of the key architect at <link wikipedia="Colonial_Williamsburg" osm="48916483" type="way">Colonial Williamsburg</link>, it was slowly reassembled from 1935-1938 on a concrete foundation, supported by steel beams.  Over the next 45 years, some 50,000 visitors passed through the house, greeted by the owners in period costume. In 1983 it was sold to Norman and Diane Bernstein, who modernized and updated the kitchen and plumbing. At that time, some of the furnishings were auctioned for $2.3 million at Christie's. In 2007 it was resold for $7.2 million, and in 2016 the house was listed for sale again.  The house measures 8,250 square feet, with 11 fireplaces, and has near-12-foot ceilings, interior columns, stenciled floors, and wallpaper designed in Paris in the early 1800s. [2]

      <p id="GL625_458_001" num_links="2">The music about the church was written by Dr. William S. Pitts in 1857 following a coach ride that stopped in Bradford, Iowa.  The church is in a valley near the town, though the church was not actually built until several years later.  In the years since, the church has become known simply as "the Little Brown Church". When Pitts returned to the area with his wife in 1862 he discovered a church being erected where he imagined it. The congregation had been meeting in various temporary spaces until Rev. J.K. Nutting led the drive to create a permanent home for the congregation.  During this period, Pitts had been teaching singing at nearby Bradford Academy and taught his class to sing his song for the first time at the dedication of the church in 1864.[1][2][3] Pitts later sold the rights to the song for a nominal sum. After the church closed in 1888 due to economic downturn in the town, the Society For the Preservation of the Little Brown Church was founded. By 1914, services were again held in the building.  Shortly afterward, the small congregation experienced a revival that attracted new attention to it and to its song. Among those who found and loved the song at this time was the Weatherwax Quartet.  This group of traveling singers traveled throughout <link wikipedia="Canada" osm="424313760 1428125" type="node relation">Canada</link> and the <link wikipedia="United_States" osm="424317935 148838" type="node relation">United States</link> in the 1920s and '30s and used as their trademark song "The Church in the Wildwood." They would quite easily talk about the little church during their travels. As the song grew in popularity, coupled with the development of the U.S. Highway system in the mid-1920s, many visitors came to the newly reopened little church. Since then the church has become a popular tourist spot, and remains so today.  It attracts thousands of visitors every year to see or be married in the "little brown church in the vale." The church is currently a member of the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches.
