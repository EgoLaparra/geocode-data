It was the first major mall to be built in southeastern Arizona, with 400,000 square feet (37,000 m2) of retail space.[2]

The mall was expanded substantially in the 1980s adding a long wing created from the closed R. H. White building, leading to a new JCPenney store. In 1992 Sage-Allen closed their store at the mall and was replaced by a Service Merchandise store. Around that time, Toys "R" Us built a store that was attached to Bradlees, but only had an exterior entrance. Market Basket is now located on an outlot.  In 1999, more changes came to the mall. Service Merchandise closed their store in 1999 and as a result, the long side wing leading to their old store emptied out. In 2000, the mall big-boxed the wing turning much of it into an <link wikipedia="Old_Navy" osm="39416708" type="way">Old Navy</link> store along with replacing Service Merchandise with a Circuit City store. After Bradlees departure in 2001, the mall was left with a large vacancy. The former Bradlees store was later demolished in 2002 and its former mall entrance was replaced with an outdoor entrance to the mall. In the same year, Filene's opened a large two-level store at the mall, one entrance down from the former Bradlees store.[5]

The shopping centre was built in two phases between 1972 and 1981–83 with a refurbishment completed in 1997.[2]  A proposal to extend the shopping centre for a third phase is pending.
In 1996 plans to broadcast an episode of Family Fortunes live from the Mercat Centre were scrapped due to concerns that the event would not be covered by the Centre's insurance company. Les Dennis described the decision as "unfortunate, but sadly unavoidable".

Mac and Doris, ready to retire after 20 years, sought a buyer who would maintain the mission of the school, and in 1984 found such a buyer in a group of teachers from Milton Academy, led by David and Nancy Grant. The Grants as co-directors reopened the school as a semester program, retaining the character and mission but allowing high school students from around the country to attend for one semester of their junior year. Today, students still attend for one term (fall or spring) during their junior year in high school, or the fall term of their senior year. 45 students are enrolled.

      <p id="GL626_170_003" num_links="2">The history of The Orchard started in 1897 (the orchard itself was first planted in 1868) when a group of Cambridge students asked the landlady, Mrs Stevenson of Orchard House, if they could take their tea in the orchard rather than on the front lawn as the custom was. This practice soon became the norm, and the place grew in popularity. The next phase in the history of The Orchard began when the poet Rupert Brooke took up lodging in the house in 1909. A graduate student of great popularity in the university community at the time, Brooke soon attracted a great following at the place, among them Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, E.M. Forster, Bertrand Russell, Augustus John, and <link wikipedia="Ludwig_Wittgenstein" osm="3601143406" type="node">Ludwig Wittgenstein</link> – the so-called Grantchester Group, or the neo-pagans as Woolf called them.

Written while Brooke was in <link wikipedia="Berlin" osm="240109189 62422" type="node relation">Berlin</link> in 1912, the poem ends with the lines:

After Grant was convicted of tax evasion in 1996 he sold the  facility to T. D. Jakes, a fellow televangelist, who renamed it and relaunched it as The Potter's House.[2][3]
Jakes had moved from West Virginia with 50 families, who formed the nucleus of the new congregation.[4]
To handle expansion, the church built a 191,000-square-foot (17,700 m2) sanctuary at a cost of $45 million, paying off the debt in four years.
The auditorium was completed in August 2000 and features cascade seating, a large stage, a choir loft that can seat 450 and a state-of-the-art audio-visual system.
The sanctuary seats about 7,600 people and is also used for non-church events such as graduations, concerts and corporate presentations.[4][5]
By 2000 Jakes was holding three services every Sunday, with attendance of over 23,000 in the sanctuary and the overflow room.[3]

The building was erected on the former site of One Meridian Plaza which was seriously damaged by a deadly fire in 1991. One Meridian Plaza was demolished in 1999 and the property was sold by E/R Partners to the Arden Group the next year. Development of the site by the Arden Group, which owns the adjacent <link wikipedia="Ritz-Carlton_Philadelphia" osm="333204594" type="way">Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia</link>, was delayed for years as a result of a feud with rival developer Mariner Commercial Properties. Mariner owned the property 1441 Chestnut Street, which sits south of the Residences at The Ritz-Carlton site and intends to build its own residential tower. The feud began after Arden Group's lead partner Craig Spencer blocked approval of 1441 Chestnut Street because he felt the tower's design would be detrimental to the planned Residences at The Ritz-Carlton tower. This led to several years of dispute between the developers trying to block construction of each other's towers.

"Uncloudy Day" was an early influence on Bob Dylan, who said of it in 2015, "It was the most mysterious thing I'd ever heard... I'd think about them even at my school desk...Mavis looked to be about the same age as me in her picture (on the cover of "Uncloudy Day")...Her singing just knocked me out...And Mavis was a great singer—deep and mysterious.

The school was formed by the merger of The St Augustine of Canterbury Church of England/Roman Catholic VA School and Ladymead Community School.[2] Its original sponsors were Somerset County Council and the Diocese of Bath and Wells, however the school transferred to the Richard Huish Trust in 2015 and is now sponsored by Richard Huish College.[3] It was opened on 9 September 2010 by Peter Price, the Bishop of Bath and Wells.
Initially the academy admitted pupils aged 11 to 16 and will be based in the existing schools' buildings. In September 2011, the academy opened a sixth form for 100 students. In 2013, the academy moved to new and refurbished buildings on the former Ladymead site on Cheddon Road, with the former St Augustine site being closed.[4]
This plan was temporarily put on hold following the government's major review of the Building Schools for the Future programme in July 2010,[5]
and was subject to review by the Department for Education.[6][7]

There are about 28 full-sized castings, in which the figure is about 186 cm high, though not all were made during Rodin's lifetime and under his supervision. There are various other versions, several in plaster, and studies and posthumous castings exist in a range of sizes.

Rodin based this on The Divine Comedy of <link wikipedia="Dante_Alighieri" osm="4622803513" type="node">Dante Alighieri</link>, and most of the figures in the work represented the main characters in the poem with The Thinker at the center of the composition over the doorway and somewhat larger than most of the other figures. Some critics believe that it was originally intended to depict Dante at the gates of Hell, pondering his great poem. Other critics reject that theory, pointing out that the figure is naked while Dante is fully clothed throughout his poem, and that the sculpture's physique does not correspond to Dante's effete figure.[1]  The sculpture is nude, as Rodin wanted a heroic figure in the tradition of Michelangelo, to represent intellect as well as poetry.[citation needed]

The modern version of the Tequila Sunrise cocktail was invented by Trident bartenders Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice in the early 1970s. In 1972, at a private party at the Trident organized by Bill Graham to kick off the Rolling Stones' 1972 tour in America, Mick Jagger had one of the cocktails, liked it, and he and his entourage started drinking them.[2] They later ordered them all across America, even dubbing the tour itself their "cocaine and tequila sunrise tour".[3][4]
