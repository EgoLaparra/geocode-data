In 1848, they gave the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad three miles (5 km) of right-of-way, upon which railroad officials named the depot Wheaton.[6][8] In 1850, ten blocks of land were platted and anyone who was willing to build immediately was granted free land. In 1853, the lots were surveyed and a formal plat for the community was filed with the county. The community was then incorporated as a village on February 24, 1859, with Warren serving as its first President.[9] The village was later incorporated as a city on April 24, 1890, when the first mayor of the city was selected, Judge Elbert Gary, son of Erastus Gary and founder of <link wikipedia="Gary,_Indiana" osm="153543923 127298" type="node relation">Gary, Indiana</link>.[9]

The civil parish is located south of the nearby town Dereham and is formed from the two ancient parishes which centred round the churches of St Mary's Whinburgh and St Andrew's Westfield, and until 1894 the churches performed all the functions of local government.[3] Norfolk was a county of small villages and parishes. The County of Norfolk Review Order, 1935, sought to rationalise this, and under this Westfield Parish was 'abolished' and merged with Whinburgh Parish. The name of the resultant parish was not changed from Whinburgh.[3] For many years nothing was done about the parish's name, but on 2 August 1995, at the request of the Parish Council, Breckland Council sealed a 'Notice of the Change of Parish Name' and the parish then became Whinburgh and Westfield.[3]

Henry White, an American diplomat and a retired ambassador to Italy and France, purchased the property in 1910. He hosted numerous social events during his stay, inviting well-known guests, including Georges Clemenceau, Robert Cecil, Henry Cabot Lodge and President Warren Harding. 
In 1917, Henry White lent the house to the French mission of Marshal Joseph Joffre to use as its headquarters. While the French flag flew outside of the residence, Marshal Joffre used the house to host high-level strategic meetings. Many important conversations were had at the dining room table, including conversations that led to the establishment of the U.S Department of Health, <link wikipedia="United_States_Department_of_Education" osm="48037721" type="way">Education</link> and Welfare. When Henry White died, the house was passed on to his son John Campbell White. Financier Eugene Meyer rented the home while he was Chairman of the Federal Reserve (1930–1933), after which he bought the bankrupt Washington Post at auction. In 1934, Meyer bought the house from White for $355,000.

In the 1920s, a group of investors led by Clarence J. Sanger had a new vision for a cemetery and proposed their idea to Detroit architect Alvin Harley. After viewing Harley's initial designs, Sanger urged him to make them more grand. Construction began in 1925 and the cemetery began operation in 1929.[1]  Harley's plan created a long central boulevard flanked by rectangular sections extending from the main gate.  The boulevard ends at a two-story T-shaped mausoleum faced in white marble, set on a white marble base.  Above the central entrance is a square two-story tower which houses a grand hall. Directly behind the hall is one of three chapels in the structure. Crypts are housed in wings extending to the east and west of the grand hall.

The town was once significantly larger and home to industrial activity such as pottery and brick-making, and coal and sand mining took place nearby.  The town's economic importance was significant enough for the Whitecliffs Branch, a branch line railway from the Midland Line, to be built to the town.  It opened on 3 November 1875.  Passenger services ceased on 13 March 1949, and due to declining freight, the line was closed entirely on 31 March 1962.  The railway's engine shed still stands in the town.
