The lower part of The Tuckies, in Ferry Road, is still badly affected by flooding and head-height water levels are clearly displayed in a doorway at The Boat Inn where the 1922 memorial footbridge crosses the River Severn to Coalport. The Severn Valley railway, operated by GWR, ran through The Tuckies and the original railway bridge, now forming part of the Severn Valley Way, still crosses the road there, at OS grid reference 693024.

The building is thought to date from the 17th century and by the 19th century it was used as a roadside inn. Its restaurant was run by Chef Patron James Sommerin until 2013; it gained a Michelin star in 2007. It contains eight double rooms and a 2-acre (0.81 ha) garden. On 7 March 2013, it closed because of financial difficulties; at the time it had the longest held Michelin star in Wales. Critics praised the food under Sommerin, but have criticised the difficulty in finding the restaurant. It re-opened in October 2013 under new chef and owner Chris Harrod, and regained the Michelin star in 2014. Harrod serves a menu using locally produced meat and vegetables along with foraged ingredients such as charlock, hedge bedstraw and pennywort.

Enrico Caruso made his debut in Berlin here, and the Ballets Russes appeared with Anna Pavlova. In the 1930s it was run as the Volkstheater Berlin. After World War II it served as the temporary opera house of Berlin, the Städtische Oper (Municipal Opera). In 1961 it became the first theatre in Germany to show musicals. Since then it has become the "German equivalent of Broadway extravaganzas", putting on plays and musical comedies.[1]

      <p id="GL627_145_001" num_links="2">In the holiday season of 1920, Mrs. Fairfax Proudfit Walkup called a group of interested friends to form a "little theatre."  The Memphis Little Theatre Players was thus founded in 1920 and presented three one-act plays ("The Dream," "Aren't They Wonders," and "Helena's Husband") as its first performance on May 20, 1921 in Germania Hall at Third Street and Jefferson Avenue.  The company was chartered on January 17, 1922 for the purpose of "producing plays, encouraging the art and the writing of plays, and the uplift of the drama and its allied arts..."  Later stagings occurred in the auditorium of the Nineteenth Century Club on Third Street and at St. Agnes Conservatory on Vance.  In 1925, a merger was made with the Drama League (the local chapter of a national organization that supported the theatrical arts), and a new Memphis Little Theatre was born.  Also in 1925, the Theatre opened its doors to its first permanent home, named the Stable Playhouse, a 90-seat venue housed in a former stable on the grounds of the <link wikipedia="James_Lee_House_(690_Adams_Avenue,_Memphis)" osm="571848248" type="way">James Lee Art Academy</link> at Adams and Orleans.  Through the generosity of many Memphians who gave "One Hundred Dollar" subscriptions, and through the courtesy of the Memphis Park Commission, in  October 1929 the Memphis Little Theatre moved into its second permanent home (the Pink Palace Playhouse) a 250-seat venue in the east wing of the Memphis Museum of Natural History and Industrial Arts (now known as the <link wikipedia="Pink_Palace_Museum_and_Planetarium" osm="135459980" type="way">Pink Palace</link>), the unfinished mansion of Piggly Wiggly founder, Clarence Saunders.  The theatre operated in the shallow end of the swimming pool of the mansion, a suggestion from Mrs. Clarence (Carolyn) Saunders).  In September 1970, the Commercial Appeal announced that the Little Theatre was embarking on a "mammoth drive to raise $1,291,000 for a new playhouse in Audubon Park."  By the summer of 1973 enough money had been pledged to convince the board to give architect Wells Awsumb and contractor Tom Thayer the go-ahead, and a groundbreaking was held on Sunday June 3, 1973.  In 1974, the Board chose Theatre Memphis as its new name; and on May 1,1975, the theatre opened a production of My Fair Lady in its new and present location, a 435-seat venue at 630 Perkins Extended.

Its first production, a musical collage titled If a Thousand Clarinets (Czech: Kdyby tisíc klarinetů), was premiered on 9 December 1958. Three months later Ladislav Fialka and his mime group joined the company with their production Pantomime on the Balustrade, and brought back fame to the almost forgotten theatre genre. Drama and mime companies coexisted at the theatre till Fialka's death in 1991.

Stegen spreads across this likewise narrow side valley and also along the long ridge that stands between the two dales. Running alongside the river Glan are <link wikipedia="Bundesstraße" osm="20546" type="relation">Bundesstraße</link> 423 on the right bank and the railway on the left.

The built-up area lies on the comb of a high ridge that drops off smoothly into the dale, while also forming the southern flank of another side valley, through which two more brooks flow on their way to empty into the Glan. Buildings are grouped loosely about a staggered crossroads formed by Bergstraße (“Mountain Road”) coming down the slope and Hauptstraße (“Main Street”) running over the dale's western flank.[2][3] The municipal area measures 501 ha, of which 128 ha is wooded.[4]

Heavy road traffic nonetheless brought stopovers and tourists, retail trade, demand for accommodation, and restaurants.

Ernst Alexander Leipart  (1831-1885), his father, was trained and had worked initially as a self-employed tailor specialising in women's dresses.[3]   By the time Theodor was born, however, his father had a more itinerant job, travelling for the "Bettfeder-Reinigungs-Anstalt" (literally, "Bed-springs cleaning institution").   His mother, born Wilhelmine Charlotte Friederike Schmidt, was the daughter of a machinist.   She travelled with her husband, possibly working with him on the bed-springs cleaning, while Leipart was brought up by his maternal grandparents in <link wikipedia="Neubrandenburg" osm="29680830 62705" type="node relation">Neubrandenburg</link>.   It was here that he attended middle school and here, in 1881, that he was confirmed into the church.   His schooling was made possible through funding from a local "syndikus" and brought him into contact, as he later recalled, with some excellent teachers.   Looking back, he would speculate that it was this early experience of "solidarity between [middle and working] classes" that made him a "less radical" socialist than he might otherwise have become.   Pride in his working-class background and loyalty to those class roots would nevertheless remain defining themes throughout his life.[2]

      <p id="GL627_246_001" num_links="2">Theodore Too was commissioned by Cochran Entertainment, Inc.,[2] the now-defunct production company. Andrew Cochran, the creator of Theodore Tugboat,[1][5] had told his son bedtime stories about the boats in the big harbour and how they interacted with everyone. This later became the basis for the TV series. Theodore became so popular, the company constructed a life-size model of him for marketing and promoting water safety.[2][4] The boat is unusual, as it is a full-size replica of a scale model. The original model which was used to film the series and inspired Theodore Too can be seen at <link wikipedia="Halifax,_Nova_Scotia" osm="24922221" type="node">Halifax</link>'s <link wikipedia="Maritime_Museum_of_the_Atlantic" osm="62049157" type="way">Maritime Museum of the Atlantic</link>.[6] Theodore Too was built at Snyder's Shipyard in Dayspring, Nova Scotia and launched on April 19, 2000. After sea trials out of Lunenburg, the vessel made its first port call to Halifax on May 6, 2000.[7]  The ocean-going boat made a 50-city tour down the eastern seaboard to Tampa Bay and back again through the Great Lakes to Chicago. Theodore Too became the Ambassador of the U.S. National Safe Boating Council and mascot to the U.S. Coast Guard, participating in several tall ship events.[4] For most if its time touring the eastern seaboard and Great Lakes, Theodore Too had a full-time three-person crew, headed by  Captain Bill Stewart, a 25-year veteran tugboat captain, who also had an additional nine years as a 44-foot motor lifeboat coxswain in the Canadian Coast Guard. After Cochran Entertainment went out of business, the boat was purchased by a Halifax tour boat company, Murphys on the Water. The vessel provides tours of Halifax Harbour in the summer, operating from the Cable Wharf in downtown Halifax.

The shallow "S" curve in the bridge was built to avoid fractures in the limestone bedrock that supports the bridge piers.  The road is also designated Minnesota State Highway 65.  Construction began in 1914, and it opened four years later in 1918.[1]  The bridge, which uses Melan arches of an open spandrel design, has been modified since that time. The 2,223-foot (667.6 m) crossing was designed by city engineer Frederick W. Cappelen, who also created plans for other similar bridges in Minneapolis such as the <link wikipedia="Franklin_Avenue_Bridge" osm="351691377 720897007 720899816 720899818" type="way way way way">Franklin Avenue Bridge</link>.

Considered a significant work of "Brutalist" church architecture by some critics, the building was considered unsatisfactory by members of the Church's congregation, which shrank over the years. In 2007, the church applied for a demolition permit for the building to permit sale and redevelopment of the site, with plans to relocate to a more suitable structure. A 1991 application for landmark status for the building, filed to forestall a demolition threat then, was subsequently approved. After a lawsuit and hearings, the District of Columbia issued a demolition permit in May 2009, and the building was demolished in 2014. In 2015, Third Church merged with First Church of Christ, Scientist. The congregation continues as First Church and conducts its activities in a portion of the new building.

In the vision, he saw the place where the Latter-day Saints would settle and "make the desert blossom like a rose" and where they would build their State of Deseret.
As the account goes, Brigham Young was very sick with Rocky Mountain spotted fever and was riding in the back of a wagon. After exiting Emigration Canyon and cresting a small hill, he asked to look out of the wagon. Those with him opened the canvas cover and propped him up so he could see the empty desert valley below. He then proclaimed, "It is enough. This is the right place. Drive on." The words, "this is the place," were soon heard throughout the wagon train as the Mormon pioneers descended into the valley, their long journey having come to an end. The statement was first attributed to Young by Wilford Woodruff more than thirty years after the pioneer advent.[1]

Its reservoirs helps irrigate 80,937 hectares (200,000 acres) and its power station has an installed capacity of 384 megawatts (515,000 hp). The power station is a pumped-storage type which allows it to not only generate power but the turbines can reverse and pump water back into the reservoir. Power generation occurs during periods of high demand and pumping during those of low demand such as at night.[5][6]
