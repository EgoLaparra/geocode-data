</p>
      <p id="GL628_134_002" num_links="2">Thomasville was founded in 1888 and incorporated on November 24 of that year.[8]  The former community of Choctaw Corner, dating back to the antebellum period, was a settlement west of what would become Thomasville, but when the merchants there learned that a railroad was going to bypass their town to the east, they decided to move their stores to be near the railroad.[9] The former community is now inside the city limits.  The tracks between <link wikipedia="Mobile,_Alabama" osm="153638526 254046" type="node relation">Mobile</link> and <link wikipedia="Selma,_Alabama" osm="153598206 2152348" type="node relation">Selma</link> were completed the same year that Thomasville began.  First referred to as "Choctaw", the town was named after railroad financier and former Union Civil War general, Samuel Thomas, after he donated $500 for the construction of Thomasville's first school.[5] The town had expanded by the end of the 19th century with numerous stores, several hotels and boarding houses, and a depot station.[5]  In 1899, what is now downtown was destroyed by a fire that burned several blocks of the wood frame buildings. Thomasville quickly rebuilt, this time in brick, and was once again flourishing by the start of World War I.[9]

Due to the increase in passenger rail travel, a new brick depot was built. This depot was then moved to the north side of the tracks and served as a freight agent's office. The Southern Railway eventually gave the structure to the town. The Thomasville Historical Society raised $5,000 for its restoration in 1969.[2] Another restoration was completed in the late 1990s. In July 2000, the Thomasville Railroad Passenger Depot became the home of the Thomasville Visitors' Center.[3][4]

      <p id="GL628_298_002" num_links="3">Thornhill was founded in 1794.[1] Its first settlers on Yonge Street in Thornhill were Asa Johnson (who settled on the Vaughan side) and Nicholas Miller (c.1760–1810; who settled on the Markham side). Of particular importance was the arrival of Benjamin Thorne (January 4, 1794 – July 2, 1848) in 1820 from <link wikipedia="Dorset" osm="74392" type="relation">Dorset</link>, <link wikipedia="England" osm="58447" type="relation">England</link>,[5] who was operating a gristmill, a <link wikipedia="Sawmill" osm="9158307 9479696" type="relation relation">sawmill</link>, and a tannery in the community. The settlement came to be known as Thorne's Mills, and later, Thorne's Hill, from which its current name is derived. (Thorne committed suicide in 1848, after a serious wheat market crash.)

Robles, who born in 1857, in Baviácora, Sonora, Mexico. His family relocated to Tucson in 1864, where he grew up. After spending sometime in <link wikipedia="Florence,_Arizona" osm="150943573 110778" type="node relation">Florence, Arizona</link>, he returned to Tucson and accepted a mail route to Gunsight, Arizona, near <link wikipedia="Ajo,_Arizona" osm="150963593 33021426" type="node way">Ajo</link>. It was during this time he located what is now called Robles Pass, near Cat (Back) Mountain, while searching for a shorter route to Gunsight. In 1882, he had his brother Jesús homesteaded 160 acres at what is now Robles Junction/Three Points. The brothers dug a well to set up a watering stop and stage station so Bernabe could water his horses along his mail route. He eventually gave up his mail route, and moved to the former watering stop/stage station, which at that point was called the Robles Ranch. He and his family ran the ranch for many years, even after the family had moved back to Tucson. Robles died in 1945. The old ranch house is now the Three Points/Robles Junction Community Center.[3]
