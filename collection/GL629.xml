The community takes its name from Wild Horse Creek,[3] and began in 1869 as a cavalry outpost, which soon became a railway station and had expanded to a town by the mid-1870s.  After a peak of population and business activities in the early 1900s, the town began dwindling by 1917, when most of it burned down in a great fire.  The town rebuilt, but never at the population or business-service centralization level of its earlier years, and by the 1930s, had begun to dwindle further.

In addition to Wildenberg Castle in Falera, they owned castles and estates throughout the valleys of Graubünden.[2]  Wildenberg Castle in Zernez was first mentioned as the home of the family in 1280/90.[3]  In 1296 the Bishop of Chur took the right to collect tithes from Wildenberg and pledged it to the Lords of Planta.  It is unclear if the castle went with the tithes, but by the 14th century Wildenberg was owned by the bishop and held by the Planta family.  In 1365 representatives from the communities around <link wikipedia="Chur" osm="1577255384 1684063" type="node relation">Chur</link> met for the first time at the castle under the auspices of the Planta family.

Two years after the meeting at Wildenberg and building off the 1365 agreements, they founded the League of God's House to curtail the bishop's power.[4]

Franz: "at the foot of Selun ridge there is a great cave, known as the wild man's hole, which at first is very broad and high, so that it could by entered by horse and wagon, then becomes narrower, and again wider, and in such alternation continues along various bends for a quarter of an hour before its end is reached."[1]
An examination of 15 July 1906 yielded bones of cave bears. A more detailed survey was conducted during 1923 to 1928 (published in Bächler 1934), producing a large number of bones, mostly of bears, besides a smaller number of stone tools comparable to the <link wikipedia="Wildkirchli" osm="446291120" type="node">Wildkirchli</link> finds. The bones seem to have been artificially deposited in heaps. The cave was presumably in use (either inhabited or used as a storage site for meat, or as a  sacrificial site) by prehistoric man during the Mousterian (about 40,000 to 35,000 years ago).

The log home was built in the early 19th century by her great-grandfather and has been enlarged twice.  The building was previously the home of Rachel E. Boak, Cather's grandmother.  Cather and her parents lived in the house only about a year before they moved to another home in Frederick County.  The farmhouse was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register (VLR) in 1976 and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1978.

</p>
      <p id="GL629_315_002" num_links="2">The house was originally owned by Cather's great-grandfather, Jacob Seibert.  The original portion of the home was probably built in the 1810s.  A two-story frame extension on the western end of the house was added around twenty years later while an ell was probably added sometime after the Civil War.  In 1869, the home and 4.5 acres (1.8 ha) of land was conveyed to Seibert's daughter, Rachel E. Boak.  Virginia Boak, her daughter, and Charles Cather were married at the house in December 1872.  The following year on December 7, the couple's first child, Willa Cather, was born in the house.  In 1874, Willa and her parents moved to a nearby home, Willow Shade, also listed on the NRHP.  Cather's relatives began moving to <link wikipedia="Nebraska" osm="316971452 161648" type="node relation">Nebraska</link> in the 1870s and her family followed in 1883, settling in <link wikipedia="Red_Cloud,_Nebraska" osm="151703786 169385" type="node relation">Red Cloud</link>.  The house where she was born was conveyed from Cather's grandmother to a woman named S.S. Gore.  Ownership of the home changed hands four more times until being purchased by Charles T. Brill in 1950.  At the time of the home's historical survey taken in 1976, Brill used the building as an office and retreat.[3]

It is part of the dePierrefeu Wildlife Sanctuary, which is owned by the New Hampshire Audubon Society.[2] Because the pond and the land around it are part of the sanctuary, the shore is unable to be developed. Therefore, there are no buildings around the pond and there won't be in the foreseeable future. Willard is instead surrounded by extensive amounts of wilderness and hiking trails that lead around the pond and to the summits of Bald Mountain and Goodhue Hill. Willard is a popular fishing, boating and hiking  destination, and it has become more popular with its mention in numerous magazines and newspapers.

Then he served in the General Assembly as the senator of Virginia and also as the governor for an abrupt period.

Father "Mac" as he was affectionately known in Paterson was so revered by its Irish and German Roman Catholic communities that his mere admonishing appearance in midst of Passaic County's 1880 Garret Rock May Day Riot or what national newspaper coverage of the time called "the most serious riot that has ever occurred in that section of the country" was sufficient to permit police to thereafter act to end the rioting. During his lifetime, the Pope, anyway, accorded this truly Reverend Father the extraordinary honor of naming him to the office of Papal chamberlain, which office is normally the reserve of European nobility.

This work has proven central to the modern study of classical field theories such as electromagnetism, and to the development of quantum mechanics.

Tanner was a land surveyor who noted the commercial potential of the Aurora area. He purchased a large tract of land on the west side of the river and invited his family, still in New York, to move in with him. For the next four years, Tanner harvested the land, until he briefly moved back to New York in 1839 to marry Anna Plum Makepeace. They moved back to Aurora the following year, working the farm until 1853. Together they had ten children; with this large family, Tanner required a larger house. After a few years living downtown, they moved to this house. Tanner now worked as a hardware businessman; his hardware firm stayed in business until 1979 and was the longest-running business in town.[1]

      <p id="GL629_488_002" num_links="2">The newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer died in 1911 having bequeathed $50,000 for the creation of a <link wikipedia="Pulitzer_Fountain" osm="357620536" type="node">memorial fountain</link> to be "like those in the <link wikipedia="Fontaines_de_la_Concorde" osm="6760161" type="relation">Place de la Concorde</link>, Paris France."[5] In  December 1912, the executors of Pulitzer's estate announced that New York City had approved the fountain's proposed location, in the plaza between 58th Street and 60th Street, just west of Fifth Avenue, the same plaza where the equestrian  Sherman Monument stood since 1903. The executors invited five architecture firms to participate in a competition to determine the fountain's design, and to provide designs for a "good architectural treatment of the whole plaza."[6] In January 1913, the five schemes were exhibited at the New York Public Library, including the winning scheme, designed by Carrère and Hastings. Architect Thomas Hasting's design placed the fountain in the southern half of the plaza, whereas the Sherman Monument remained in the northern half (but moved fifteen feet west to be symmetrically opposite the fountain). Construction of the new plaza began in 1915, and by November one newspaper reported: "The Pulitzer Fountain...is now finished and bubbling with the purest Croton water," noting that work on the northern portion of the plaza was delayed by subway construction.[7]

There was never any question of his pursuing the fine arts professionally—he was to be trained for a useful life, according to the Quaker ways.
