Residents and vacationers enjoy yearly events such as the Labor Day Boat Parade and Paddle Williamstown, among other summer festivities. 

There are two main public boat ramps available- The Williamstown Marina and Ruby's Boat Dock. Both offer fuel and small convenience stores, and The Williamstown Marina also delivers pizza and subs to docks.

Major issues surrounding Williamstown Lake include the Williamstown Lake Expansion Project and the nearby development of the Ark Encounter attraction.

Luther Wright, its principal from 1841 to 1849, believed it was desirable to have his pupils study together in a single room under his direction. However, the school's student population grew rapidly and the one-room schoolhouse scheme was soon no longer practicable, as more instructors and new buildings were added. By the 1850s the schools campus was dominated by three large buildings: North Hall, Middle Hall and South Hall. For many years the school was co-educational, with the students divided and taught separately in male and female departments, but in 1864 the female division was discontinued.[5][6]

It is a transfer point between the Beechview (serving Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, Dormont, and Beechview) and Overbrook (serving Overbrook, Carrick, Bon Air, and Belzhoover) lines.  The station's name was derived from Willow Ave, the street that runs parallel with and across the light rail. No parking is available at the site and because park and ride commuters can more conveniently reach the nearby Memorial Hall station, Willow almost exclusively serves nearby apartments and individuals switching trains.

The community is located in the Arkansas Delta and is surrounded by fertile cropland historically used to produce cotton. Wilson started as a company town in 1886 by Robert E. Lee Wilson, who would build a cotton empire and run it from the city. The Wilson Company would become so successful that all of the town's buildings were rebuilt in Tudor Revival architectural style following Wilson's son's honeymoon to <link wikipedia="England" osm="58447" type="relation">England</link> in 1925. Wilson did not incorporate until 1959.  Lee Wilson and Company remained in the Wilson family until 2010.[3] The community has seen a rapid decline in economic activity and population since the advent of mechanization on the farm, reducing the need for manual labor to produce cotton. The population was 903 at the 2010 census.  The town is incorporated and does not have an owner.

The cave is notable for its calcite formations known as boxwork, as well as its frostwork. Approximately 95 percent of the world's discovered boxwork formations are found in Wind Cave. The cave is recognized as the densest cave system in the world, with the greatest passage volume per cubic mile. Wind Cave is one of the longest caves in the world with 149.01 miles (239.81 km) of explored cave passageways, as of 2018[update].[3] Above ground, the park includes the largest remaining natural mixed-grass prairie in the United States.

The Berwind-White Coal Mining Company imported workers from eastern and southern Europe and exploited ethnic divisions in the area (which had been settled by Germans and Irish in the 19th century). On Good Friday 1922, coal miners walked out of the mines in Windber and several nearby locations in Somerset County, attempting to force the mine owners to recognize their United Mine Workers union, as well as accurately weigh the coal they mined. The company employed legal tactics (the United States Supreme Court decided two lawsuits) as well as strike-breakers, but the miners received considerable favorable national publicity and local support and held out until the end of the following summer.[3] However, the UMW successfully organized the mines during 1933, after the Great Depression led to the election of President <link wikipedia="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" osm="1610589818" type="node">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</link>.

Until recently, the body was also called the Windeby Girl, since an archeologist believed it to be the body of a 14-year-old girl, because of its slight build. Prof. Heather Gill-Robinson, a <link wikipedia="Canada" osm="424313760 1428125" type="node relation">Canadian</link> anthropologist and pathologist, used DNA testing to show the body was actually that of a sixteen-year-old boy.[1] The body has been radiocarbon-dated to between 41 BCE and 118 CE.

The body had been very well preserved by the peat, and despite this damage it is still an important archaeological discovery. Shortly after the discovery of Windeby I, another bog body (an adult male) was found nearby and dubbed Windeby II.
