Being such a small and dispersed mountain village, relatively few men from Windham served with the Union Army during the Civil War. Windham County itself contributed heavily to manning the 4th Vermont Infantry and most of the village's sons joined either Company C or K of that regiment. The 4th regiment saw heavy combat throughout the war.[4]  One of Windham's soldiers, Captain Charles G. Gould of Company H, 5th Vermont Infantry, won the Medal of Honor for bravery under fire.

The bridge, one of currently 17 drivable bridges in the county, is a single-span Town truss design.  The bridge sits atop cut stone abutments, one made of sandstone quarried nearby, and the other made of creek stone.  The bridge was bypassed in the 1960s and closed to traffic, and Wiswell Road was rerouted west of the creek. In the 1980s, the bridge was completely closed due to safety reasons.  It underwent extensive renovation from 2002 to 2004, and was then reopened to all traffic, except for trucks and buses.  The bridge is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.[1]  The bridge's WGCB number is 35-04-25,[2] and it is located approximately 5.0 mi (8.0 km) west of <link wikipedia="Orwell,_Ohio" osm="182833" type="relation">Orwell</link>.

Datings based on stylistic evaluation have been equally variable, ranging across the same three centuries, but perhaps tending to an earlier date.[3] For much of the 20th century, the prevailing theory, based on the works of Hermann Thiersch and Karl Lehmann, considered it a <link wikipedia="Rhodes" osm="452614 5321592" type="relation relation">Rhodian</link> monument dedicated following the victories at <link wikipedia="Side,_Turkey" osm="252131617" type="node">Side</link> and Myonessos in 190 BC, and suggested that it might have been carved by the Rhodian sculptor Pythocritus.[4] However, by the mid-2010s, the reconstructions of the monument proposed by Lehmann have been shown to be false (the remains of the surrounding space that housed the Victory belong to the Roman period), and the question of why the statue was dedicated on Samothrace, which at the time was dominated by the Greek Kingdom of Macedonia, remains unanswered.[5]

      <p id="GL631_169_002" num_links="3">Wings Place was one of the properties which was part of the manor of Ditchling Garden, one of five manors in the parish of Ditchling.  Ditchling Garden Manor dates to 1095 or earlier, when it was mentioned as part of the <link wikipedia="Lewes_Priory" osm="87550012" type="way">Priory of St. Pancras</link> in <link wikipedia="Lewes" osm="2811540" type="relation">Lewes</link> and was described as a "garden with houses and the land which is between the two roads, with the wood adjoining it".  After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry VIII came into possession of it and granted Anne of Cleves the estate following their divorce.[2][1] After her death in 1557, it was given back to The Crown,[3] but by the 1570s it was owned by Henry Poole, a former Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Wootton Bassett, who had moved to Ditchling after his marriage.  Poole died in 1580,[4] and the house may have been rebuilt after that: its present appearance is largely 16th-century.[5]  The Browne family acquired the property in 1688,[3] and later residents included William Pitt and the Duke of Wellington.[6] The rooms in the upper floors also were the venue for conducting secret <link wikipedia="Catholic_Church" osm="618656792" type="way">Catholic</link> services.[1] During the Brownes' ownership, part of the house was converted into a public library.[3] By the mid-19th century, the building was divided into cottages or tenements, but in 1936 it was restored to its original layout as a single house after being auctioned the previous year.[3][2]  Later in the 20th century, it was owned for about 30 years by a reclusive American businessman and then for about 10 years by television presenter Jamie Theakston, who put it on sale in 2014 for a reported £2 million.[7]  After the asking price was reduced in early 2015, Theakston completed the sale in August 2015.[8]

Coal was discovered in the area in 1875, and later that year, the Pleasant Valley Coal Company began coal mining operations. A group of coal miners were delayed during an early winter storm in 1877, which led to the town's name of Winter Quarters.[2] On May 1, 1900, an explosion in the Winter Quarters Number Four mine killed 200 miners. Despite the mine explosion, the coal mining operations remained active until 1922, when the opening of a new mine in Castle Gate caused many people to relocate there. By 1930, Winter Quarters was abandoned.[3]
