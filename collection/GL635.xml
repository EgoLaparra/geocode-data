In 2005, the Loudoun County School Board approved the use of Fields Farm, a property north of the Town of Purcellville on County land, but in an urban growth zone jointly controlled by the Town and the County, known as PUGAMP.  The town of Purcellville was not pleased with the decision, because of traffic concerns and also because it was expected to provide essential services to the new high school, despite being located outside of the Town.  The School Board claimed that the high school's best location was in Fields Farm, and on June 20, 2006, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors voted 6-3 to start construction of Woodgrove on Fields Farm.  The Town of Purcellville pursued legal action in court to stop its construction with a <link wikipedia="Richmond,_Virginia" osm="2592301390 3864712" type="node relation">Richmond</link> legal firm; the case is still pending in Court.  In July 2006, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors reexamined the possibility of opening Woodgrove in Round Hill, but efforts were unsuccessful.

      <p id="GL635_223_001" num_links="3">Woodstock Express was designed by John C. Allen of the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC). It is based on the first three roller coasters he designed shortly after becoming the company's president in 1954. These coasters opened in 1956 at Hunt's Pier, Angela Park and the Gooding Zoo (now the <link wikipedia="Columbus_Zoo_and_Aquarium" osm="30430453" type="way">Columbus Zoo and Aquarium</link>).[1]  Allen modified the original design, making Woodstock Express a little taller and longer.  He eliminated the curved loading station as well, opting instead for an in-line station that precedes the curve to the lift hill.  This modified design was then used to build two nearly identical models at <link wikipedia="Kings_Dominion" osm="2624268097 38157094" type="node way">Kings Dominion</link> and <link wikipedia="Carowinds" osm="669969052" type="way">Carowinds</link>.[1] A third copy at Canada's Wonderland was also based on this design but is taller and slightly longer, and it was designed by Curtis D.

The Woodstock collection began as an assemblage of children's books and was housed within a public school. In 1911, the station was replaced by a "sub-branch" library offering more books for adults and children, but without the reference works and services available at regular branches. The collection moved into a larger facility in 1914, which became a full branch in 1917, offering additional resources and services.

The Woodstock School underwent expansions in 1925 and 1955, but a fire in 1980 destroyed the building's two-story center. Protests by Woodstock residents and the Woodstock Parent Teachers Association ended the school district's plans to close the school due to fire damage and low student enrollment throughout the city. The school remained open and underwent repairs, but its second story was lost. The school marks the oldest standing elementary school in Portland.[3]

Eventually they learned to eat other food and lost their green pallor, but the boy was sickly and died soon after he and his sister were baptised. The girl adjusted to her new life, but she was considered to be "rather loose and wanton in her conduct".[2] After she learned to speak English, the girl explained that she and her brother had come from Saint Martin's Land, a subterranean world inhabited by green people.

In the book, it is said that Worle was owned by Walter of Douai, and consisted of 750 acres (3.0 km2) and valued at 6.5 hides. "Walter de Dowai holds of the King, Worle. Edgar held it in the time of King Edward, and gelded for six hides and a half."[1] The parish church of St Martin's sits on the side of Worlebury Hill and overlooks the village.

Two years later, however, the plans were dropped for economic and military reasons by the other states the railway would have crossed: the Grand Duchies of Baden, Hesse and the Kingdom of Prussia. Instead, the Main-Neckar line was built on the east side of Rhine. Finally, in 1844 some citizens in Mainz and Worms took the initiative to establish a company for building a railway from Mainz to Worms. The private company constructing and later operating it was called the Hessian Ludwig Railway (German: Hessische Ludwigsbahn). Several factors such as the lean years of 1846 and 1847, the democratic uprising in 1848-1850 prolonged the opening of the line from Mainz to Worms until 1853.
