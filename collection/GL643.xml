      <p id="GL643_138_001" num_links="2">In 1910 <link wikipedia="Yolo_County,_California" osm="396507" type="relation">Yolo County</link> set up its county library system, and the community of Yolo was one of the first areas with a library branch. Funding from Andrew Carnegie was sought for after his recent funding for Woodland Public Library in neighboring <link wikipedia="Woodland,_California" osm="2584100971 112607" type="node relation">Woodland, California</link>. One of Carnegie's employees, James Beltram, felt that the county had received their allotment of Carnegie mony, but the county librarian still sought the funding. The Yolo County librarian corresponded with James Beltram for roughly 20 letters when $3,000 was finally offered to construct a new branch in 1917. Once Beltram realized the county's intent of putting the branch in Yolo, he objected to the funding again, this time on the basis that the community was too close to the formerly funded library. Yolo was defended with the fact that its current facilities were out of date and that it served a large rural base.[3]

The younger Yorba lived in the adobe until 1868, when Forty-Niner and Mexican–American War veteran Fenton M. Slaughter bought the house. Slaughter, who later served in the California State Assembly, lived in the house until his 1897 death.[3]

The theatre puts on many of its own productions, as well as hosting touring companies, one of which is Pilot Theatre, a national touring company which often co-produces its work with the theatre. Additionally the main stage and studio are regularly used by local amateur dramatic and operatic societies. York Theatre Royal was one of the co-producers of the historic York Mystery Plays 2012 which were staged in <link wikipedia="York_Museum_Gardens" osm="3600440" type="relation">York Museum Gardens</link> between 2–27 August. The theatre reopened on Friday 22 April 2016 following a £6million redevelopment, with a new roof, an extended and re-modelled front of house area, a refurbished and redecorated main auditorium and with major improvements to access and environmental impact.
