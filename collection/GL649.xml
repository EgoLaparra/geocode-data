It was once accessible by branches of the King's Highway, and is situated in the semi-arid steppe region of the Jordanian Desert. The site has been allied to the biblical settlement of Mephaat mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah. The Roman military utilized the site as a strategic garrison, but it was later converted and inhabited by Christian and Islamic communities. In 2004, the site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[1] and is valued by archaeologists for its extensive ruins dating to the Roman, Byzantine, and early Muslim periods. Studium Biblicum Franciscanum[2] carried out excavations at the north end of the site in 1986, but much of the area remains buried under debris.

Eusebius of Caesarea identified Mephaat as the camp site of a Roman army near the desert in his Onomasticon (K.128:21).[6] Also, the excavation of a Byzantine church here exposed an inscription naming the area as "Castron Mephaa" further supporting the theory that Umm-ar Rasas and the biblical Mephaat are one and the same.[7]

Designed by noted American architect Cass Gilbert, the beaux-arts Union Station was completed and opened in 1920[4] after the previous Union Station (which was located at the foot of Meadow Street, near the site of the current Union Station parking garage) was destroyed by fire. It served the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad until it fell into decline, along with the rest of the railroad industry in North America after <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link>. It was shuttered in 1972, leaving only the under-track 'subway' open for passengers, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 3, 1975,[2] but it was almost demolished before the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project in 1979. Reopened after extensive renovations in early 1985, it is now the premier gateway to the city.

The town's best years were during the 1870s, when it was an active mining and prospecting town serving the surrounding hilly region.  For a brief time, Samuel Langhorne Clemens lived there and prospected, but left without having had much success. Currently, the hamlet consists of a single business – a tourist inn – and a few small houses clustered along or near the gravel roadway which permits vehicular ingress and egress.  The nearest paved road, an extension of this gravel road, is about 7 miles to the east. The nearest services of any sort, other than those available at the inn, are approximately one hour's drive away.

      <p id="GL649_426_002" num_links="2">Now in <link wikipedia="Pershing_County,_Nevada" osm="166459" type="relation">Pershing County</link>, Unionville was the original county seat for <link wikipedia="Humboldt_County,_Nevada" osm="166458" type="relation">Humboldt County</link>, serving in that capacity from its founding in July 1861 until the seat was relocated to Winnemucca in 1873.[1]  The big mining boom at Unionville occurred between 1863 and 1870.  During that time, the population was reported to be as high as 1,500 persons. Mark Twain arrived in Unionville with the intention of prospecting for silver in 1862, describing the town as consisting of "eleven cabins and a liberty-pole".  As is common in most mining communities, after the boom, the town experienced a decline soon afterwards.  By 1870, it was discovered that there was little rich ore in the district.  The decline was speeded by the completion of the Central Pacific Railroad through the Humboldt valley, and the establishment of Winnemucca as a major trading and shipping center.[2]

The present church as built in 1771-74; the town of Brooklyn was incorporated in 1786.  Its construction, first proposed in 1763, was opposed for many years by local Anglicans, resulting in the construction of <link wikipedia="Trinity_Church_(Brooklyn,_Connecticut)" osm="359270618" type="node">Trinity Church</link>.  In the early 19th century, the congregation was split between Trinitarians and Unitarians, with the latter ultimately retaining control of this building.  The building was restyled in 1845, relocating the entrance to a new tower on the side, building a full second floor at the gallery level, and replacing the box pews and pulpit.  All of the interior changes were reversed in the late 20th century, restoring it to its original form.  The tower, whose steeple was replaced after the New England Hurricane of 1938, was retained.[2]
