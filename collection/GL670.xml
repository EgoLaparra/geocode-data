A grand promenade one hundred metres long was added at the end of the 18th century.  Beginning in 1866, the new owner, Julien de Cerval, who was inspired by Italian gardens, built rustic structures, redesigned the parterres, laid out five kilometres of walks, and planted pines and cypress trees.[2][3]

The cave has a wide entrance but narrows down in some places. An iron gate was installed at the first constriction in 1991 to preserve those of the delicate lava formations or speleothems which hadn't already been destroyed.

Originally licensed for daytime operations only, WTOL was granted authority for around-the-clock operations in 1939 and affiliated with NBC's Blue Network (later to become ABC Radio) shortly thereafter. Programming on WTOL, until the mid-1960s, was a full-service format of news, information, sports, ABC network programs and various types of music, including pop, country, jazz, and, by the early 1960s, some rock and roll. The station started broadcasting 24 hours a day in 1962 with the new format "Demand Radio 123". The format was very tightly controlled, and the announcers said very little, other than time and weather. there were scripted intros for songs. The playlist contained about 200 popular favorites of the 40s and 50s. The tight format wore out in less than two years. In 1964 WTOL became a personality driven full service facility, and played popular music, while avoiding "hard rock". You could hear the Beatles, and the Stones, but only songs like Yesterday, Michelle, and As Tears Go By. For many years, WTOL was a family of three broadcast stations which included <link wikipedia="WTOL" osm="357495645 357509658" type="node node">TV-11</link> and <link wikipedia="WIOT" osm="357509546" type="node">FM-104.7</link>.

[1]  Bahakel acquired the station in 1963; previous owners of the station include Norman Thomas and Earl Winger (who owned a crystal radio company, and started WDOD to give people who bought their radios a station to listen to), as well as H. Clay Evans and Interstate Insurance.[1] From 1948 to 1997 it was Chattanooga's original country radio station, and added a FM simulcast on WDOD-FM in 1960. The simulcast continued until WDOD-FM changed its format to AAA.
WDOD was briefly an affiliate of Air America Radio in 2005-2006.[2] Prior to that the station had an adult standards format.[3]  Until 2009, the station derived a portion of its programming from Scott Shannon's The True Oldies Channel from Citadel Media.[4]

By 1947, the station had settled on its present 97.1 home as WWJ-FM, originally simulcasting WWJ.  By the end of the 1960s WWJ-FM had separated programming and begun airing a beautiful music format with programming coming from Schulke Radio Productions (SRP), with which it enjoyed high ratings despite a glut of easy-listening competition in the market from stations such as 95.5 WLDM, 96.3 WJR-FM, 100.3 WNIC and 104.3 WOMC. In addition, during the 1970s WWJ-AM simulcast WWJ-FM's programming during overnight hours.
