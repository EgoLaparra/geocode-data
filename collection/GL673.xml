The school, which is located on Chicago's near north side, is one of the city's nine selective enrollment high schools. It was named after football legend Walter Payton, a former member of the Chicago Bears who died shortly before the school opened. The school colors are blue and orange, the colors of the Chicago Bears. After principal Gail Ward left the school in 2006, Ellen Estrada became principal.  In 2011, a new administration was formed under Timothy Devine with D'Andre Weaver and Michelle Washington as Assistant Principals. In May 2006 the Confucius Institute in Chicago was opened at Payton, as a partnership between Chicago Public Schools, the Office of Chinese Language Council International and Shanghai's <link wikipedia="East_China_Normal_University" osm="6179557" type="relation">East China Normal University</link> it is the only <link wikipedia="Confucius_Institute" osm="3449362004" type="node">Confucius Institute</link> in the world housed in a high school.

After World War I, Rogowski returned to Aachen, in 1920, and became an ordinarius professor for theoretical electro-technology and director of the Institute for Electro-Technology.  At that time, the institute was in the mining industry building.  Rogowski, with his head assistant Eugen Flegler, began to put together a plan for their own building. The draft submission to the Ministry of Education was made by the university in 1923.  However, the plan was not accomplished until 1925, with inauguration of the generous institute building on 27 October 1929. The original plan proposed to house the entire electrical engineering section in the building.  However, during the construction phase, it was decided the building would house only Rogowski’s Institute.  The main thrust of the institute was to bridge the gap between physics and electro-technology.  Work carried out in the institute included general electro-technology, theoretical electro-technology, telecommunications technology, high frequency engineering, electrical discharges in gases, and high voltage technology.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]

In 1976, a Department of Environmental Quality study determined the lake to be suffering the effects from upstream polluters closing the lake to swimming.

      <p id="GL673_107_002" num_links="7">Walterboro (original spelling: "Walterborough") was founded in 1783, as a summer retreat for local planters looking to escape their malaria-ridden, Lowcountry plantations. The original settlement was located on a hilly area, covered with pine and hickory trees and named "Hickory Valley". Two of the earliest settlers were brothers, Paul and Jacob Walter. The brothers were prosperous, plantation owners, in nearby <link wikipedia="Jacksonboro,_South_Carolina" osm="154368946" type="node">Jacksonboro</link>. Paul's small daughter Mary, was taken ill with malaria; a common disease amongst the families who constructed and cultivated their plantations in the marshy areas of the Lowcountry, due to the grounds suitability for rice production. To prevent Mary from succumbing to the deadly virus, the Walter brothers went looking for a healthier location in which to live during the summer months, and came to settle the town; with it later being named in their honor. In 1817, Walterboro was designated as the third county seat of Colleton County, and has remained such through present-day. This designation was followed by, the construction of a <link wikipedia="Colleton_County_Courthouse" osm="367805292" type="node">county courthouse</link> and <link wikipedia="Prison" osm="196399500 8710408" type="way relation">county jail</link> in 1821, with the courthouse being designed by well-known architect, Robert Mills.

After allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father's and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place townhouse/mansion during the late 1800s, he arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure built for that purpose in 1905–1909.

According to the legend a blind man regained his eyesight after praying before the statue. After that miracle a stone altar was erected in front of the tree. The first wooden chapel was built in 1263. A larger church was built in 1512 but was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War. The present pilgrimage church 'Visitation of Our Lady' goes back to a church built in 1695–1710 following a design thought to resemble the Temple in Jerusalem. However, all but the mighty Renaissance façade had to be torn down already three years later because the structure had become unsafe. The fourth and present church in Baroque style was then built 1715–1723, and financed by the local nobleman and owner Count Franz Anton von Götzen. Around the church and village a huge calvary (a set of chapels dedicated to the Passion of Christ) was built. In 1936 the church received the status of a 'Basilica minor' from Pope Pius XI.

The work was officially inaugurated in 1933,[1] being initially opposed by parish leader, Don Giuseppe Camagni (1921-1957). Tina Magni, first librarian and historical brugherese, remembers that the pastor opposed since 1929 the official inauguration of said monument.[3] The chronological gap between the construction work and the official opening is evident from the archival material stored in the Public Library of Brugherio, showing the diplomatic efforts made by the deans of Brugherio's schools aimed at reconciling the two highest authorities of the city, mainly the mayor and the parish priest.[4]
