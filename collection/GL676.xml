American Airlines submitted a proposal to start service between Waterloo and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport operated by their regional carrier, American Eagle, via a code sharing agreement . American sent representatives to Waterloo to present to the Chamber of Commerce and a straw poll of area businesses showed local companies favored service to Chicago over Minneapolis. American said they plan to only need the EAS subsidy for two years, when they believe that service will be self-sustaining. The Waterloo city council sent a recommendation to the DOT that American be awarded the contract and on December 8 DOT awarded American Eagle the contract. The regional airline affiliate of American Airlines initially operated flights twice daily.[2]  American Eagle previously served Waterloo with ATR-42 and Saab 340 turboprop flights to Chicago during the 1990s.[3][4]

These sediments of silt, clay and very fine sand particles called "loess," were then carried by strong westerly winds and deposited when these winds encountered the steep slopes of the east valley wall.

The original location of the village was intended to be at Packham's Mill, about where Mill Road crosses the railroad track today two miles southeast of today's downtown Waunakee. However, two local settlers, Louis Baker and George Fish, platted a village on their land two miles further northwest along the railroad. Railroad officials agreed to moving a train depot to the new community in exchange for $1,500 and two miles of right of way.[9] The village was founded in 1871 and formally incorporated in 1893.[10] Baker and Fish did not want to take credit for naming the community, so they asked Simeon Mills and Mr. Hill of Madison to come up with a list. The name "Waunakee" has a Native American origin meaning "fair and pleasant valley."

The bridge was built by Galen Clark, the steward of what was then called the Yosemite Grant, in 1868, without its cladding.  The bridge was a major component of Clark's proposed new road from Wawona to the Yosemite Valley. Clark was unable to complete the road, which he sold to the Washburn Group of investors along with the <link wikipedia="Wawona_Hotel" osm="164768948" type="way">Wawona Hotel</link>.

The bridge served automobile traffic until 1937, when a new bridge was built about 200 metres (660 ft) to the southwest. The bridge was repaired by Civilian Conservation Corps labor the same year. In 1955 the bridge was damaged by flooding. Marked for replacement on account of the damage and its poor general condition, the bridge was instead reconstructed after <link wikipedia="National_Park_Service" osm="293087669" type="way">National Park Service</link> landscape architect Thomas Chalmers Vint intervened in its favor. Work was funded as part of the Park Service's Mission 66 program, using the bridge as the centerpiece of an interpretive exhibit on the history of the Wawona area. The Pioneer Yosemite History Center was established nearby. The bridge was repaired, with damaged elements replaced in kind. Since 1957 the bridge has had a number of repairs and replacements as materials have deteriorated.[2][3]

It has recently been restored and opened to the public. The village has an extensive beach backed by dunes. Many migrant birds pass through the area in spring and autumn and common cranes feed in fields near the village.

In the Middle Ages Waxweiler was part of Austrasia in the Frankish Empire. Around 700, Saint Willibrord (657–739), a Benedictine monk from Northumbria, brought Christianity to Waxweiler (see also <link wikipedia="Dancing_procession_of_Echternach" osm="4993555980" type="node">Dancing procession of Echternach</link>) and at that time the Church was founded in the town.

In 1945 and 1946, to make emergency repairs for extensive destruction by bombing and artillery, every able-bodied male inhabitant, age 16 to 60, was obligated to perform repairs or equivalent work without pay. Shortly before Christmas in 2004, a massive fire destroyed the bell tower of the church and caused extensive damage. The church and tower were rebuilt within two years.

The population was 966 at the 2010 census.  Wayland was originally known as Crooked Creek.  Crooked Creek became a voting precinct October 5, 1840.  The first burial is given to John Bullock in 1838. He came as a surveyor to this region in 1837.  The need to establish a post office followed.  Rufus M. Pickell, one of the local leaders, was appointed on February 3, 1843, postmaster for the land East of the Skunk River and South of Crooked Creek.   Pickell was also a blacksmith by trade.  Establishing a church followed, so the little log cabin Methodist Church was built in 1844.  From 1851 to 1880 the town was known as  Marshall.[4] Christian Roth Sr. erected a brewery on his homestead in 1856, which was completed at a cost of over $4,000.  Until its closing by laws passed in 1884, it had done a prosperous business and had a capacity of 10 barrels a day.  Confusion over the name Marshall, Henry County and Marshalltown, Iowa, especially with mail getting mixed, required in 1879 a change in the smaller town relinquishing its name and taking up a new one in 1880.  In the 1879 Henry County History book the following names can be found in Jefferson Township: Burrows, Clifton, Cook, Davies, Everts, Farmer, Hull, Jessup, Johnson, Manning, Mathews, Moore, Noble, Ressel, Sayles, Shively, Turney, Walker, Wallbank, Wiggins, and Williams.
