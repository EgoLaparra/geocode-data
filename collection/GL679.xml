Like many other villages along the east coast Wesley developed after Emancipation on hilly land along the boundary between the two estates as labourers sought to establish independent holdings for themselves away from the plantations where they had formerly lived and worked. In the mid 19th century, Charles Leatham, owner of Eden, sold several small lots in this area. His estates had been centres for early evangelization by Wesleyan missionaries and by as early as 1837 religious and night school gatherings were being held in a large estate building on Londonderry estate. Methodist influence grew further when free labourers were introduced into the estates of the north-east from <link wikipedia="Antigua" osm="7117069" type="relation">Antigua</link>, <link wikipedia="Montserrat" osm="424314005 537257" type="node relation">Montserrat</link>, and other <link wikipedia="Leeward_Islands" osm="5279730025" type="node">Leeward Islands</link> to replant the sugar estates in cocoa and limes. By the 1860s the settlement was referred to as Wesleyville and was dominated by a woman shopkeeper called Ma Wesley. Eventually the place was simply called Wesley, while the district continued to be called by its old French parish name, La Soie (La Swa). At the end of the 19th century the Roman Catholic Church began to make a move to evangelize the area, but so strong was the Protestant influence that it had to buy land for the first church by using one of its faithful to purchase the land in his name and then to declare it for the church after the sale was completed. Tensions between the two faiths were high for a time. In the 1940s and 1950s large-scale land settlement schemes in the interior organized by the British government enabled villagers to buy Crown Lands and free themselves of dependency on the estates. This coincided with the beginning of the banana boom and Wesley benefited materially from this development. Economic growth enabled villagers to improve their housing and send children to secondary schools in Roseau. In 1979 the opening of St.Andrew's High School provided such education closer to home. National political changes also had an effect on the general changes in the community.

The district encompasses 36 contributing buildings in a primarily residential section of Darlington. They were constructed between about 1890 and 1928. Most of the residences are grand in scale and reflect the prosperity of the individuals who built them. Several of the houses were owned by some of Darlington's most prominent citizens. Most of the residences are large, two-story frame Victorian or Queen Anne structures with decorative woodwork. The dwellings are set on deep lots that are planted with large trees and shrubs. A number of these large residences are similar in appearance and were built by master carpenter Lawrence Reese. Also included in the district are 13 modest, one-story frame houses with a few decorative features, as well as two imposing brick bungalows.[2][3]

The park was completed in 1979. Another reclamation project was later undertaken by PSA Singapore in the 1980s for port development. This latter project mostly removed access to the coastline, surrounded most of the park by high-traffic roads, and spoilt the ambience by giant cranes and other structures built for the adjacent container terminal. Subsequently, visitorship declined considerably. National Parks Board (NParks) then introduced a redevelopment project for West Coast Park in 1998 to remediate the problem. By 2000, Phase 1 development that covers the western portion of the park was completed. The park was revitalized with an improvement in infrastructure, along with the addition of facilities and features.[1]

This bridge would also be destroyed and the current bridge would be completed circa 1864. Utilizing the central pier from the previous incarnation, despite the Town lattice being able to withstand the weight and single span, the bridge has two spans. The later addition of queen trusses and supports gives the bridge an unusual appearance. Modernization of the bridge in 1968 and 1973 has continued to let the bridge handle traffic. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

It is this township that would be divided in 1796 to form <link wikipedia="Pine_Township,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania" osm="3417458" type="relation">Pine</link> and Deer townships.[4] Deer Township was made up of what is today the eastern parts of Richland and West Deer, Frazer, most of East Deer, part of Hampton, and all of Fawn and Harrison.[5] Deer gets its name from Chief Deer, a sub-chief of Iroquois leader Guyasuta. Half of Deer Township was used to create <link wikipedia="Indiana_Township,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania" osm="6885847" type="relation">Indiana Township</link> in 1805. In 1836, upon petition of its citizens, Deer was divided into <link wikipedia="East_Deer_Township,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania" osm="6885865" type="relation">East Deer</link> and West Deer. In 1860, the western boundary of West Deer was moved eastward, the land being used to form <link wikipedia="Richland_Township,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania" osm="6885849" type="relation">Richland Township</link>. In 1861, part of the southwestern corner of West Deer was used to form <link wikipedia="Hampton_Township,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania" osm="188053" type="relation">Hampton Township</link>. West Deer also annexed land along it southern border from Indiana Township in this exchange.[4] Historically, much of West Deer's economy has been based on farming and coal mining. Many coal towns such as Curtisville, Bairdford, and Russellton were dominant forces in the industry. In recent years, significant suburban growth has occurred in the southwestern and central portions of the township, while other portions have remained rural.
