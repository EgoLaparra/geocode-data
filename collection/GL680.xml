Since there was already another Madison City in Ohio, the postmaster general demanded a name change.  According to legend, as old-timers were discussing the new name around the cracker barrel in the general store, a can of Heno tea caught their attention. So the town was named for the tea. But in 1907, the postmaster general decreed the village was within the shadow of Middletown, and only a few postal workers had ever heard of Heno, making it difficult to sort and forward mail to the place. The government ordered the village to accept the name of West Middletown. In 1963 the postmaster general in another decree closed the West Middletown post office, transferring its business to Middletown.

It is architecturally significant for its innovative uses of wrought iron as a framing material, and is historically significant for its role in the American Civil War. It housed the Wheeling Convention (1861), as well as the West Virginia Constitutional Convention (1863), which resulted in the separation of Unionist <link wikipedia="West_Virginia" osm="317006365 162068" type="node relation">West Virginia</link> from Confederate <link wikipedia="Virginia" osm="317004702 224042" type="node relation">Virginia</link>.

The steel reinforcements of the arch rings extend deep into the bridge's piers and abutments, allowing the piers to be substantially thinner. This design was inspired by the works of Edwin Thacher.[2] Although this bridge is made of concrete, a series of recessed panels, which have the aggregate exposed, provides texture and contrast.[2]

      <p id="GL680_327_002" num_links="5">The village of West Wemyss began as a settlement around the site of Wemyss Castle which developed into a centre for the salt industry in the area.[1][4] A harbour was later built in 1621 by the Wemyss family for the use of coal exportation from the pits on the lands of their estate.[3] The harbour would become a major export point for coal by the late 17th century.[3] The ships brought back imports of wood, iron and flax from the <link wikipedia="Baltic_states" osm="4857459" type="relation">Baltic Countries</link>.[3] A wet dock was added for the increased demand of the coal in the 1870s.[3] Towards the latter stages of the 19th century, the village found itself surrounded by several mines - such as the Michael Pit in nearby <link wikipedia="East_Wemyss" osm="29343057" type="node">East Wemyss</link>.[5] The industry, which saw trade with <link wikipedia="England" osm="58447" type="relation">England</link> and The Low Countries, started to struggle once the new docks were opened in <link wikipedia="Methil" osm="529117977" type="node">Methil</link> further along the Fife coast. Gradually, the demand for the harbour began to fall and it went into decline.[5] The harbour has since been filled in and part of the old village restored,[3] becoming a conservation area with several attractive buildings.[5] William Angus Knight, Professor of Moral Philosophy at <link wikipedia="University_of_St_Andrews" osm="3504913908" type="node">St Andrews University</link>, editor and biographer of William Wordsworth, lived here as a child from 1844.

All five communities decided to retain the institutes. Some members of the Westchester County Board of Supervisors objected to taking on the management of the New York Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences, but community organizations, such as women's clubs, business men's leagues, and civic associations, voiced support. Some even pledged scholarships. A deal was reached so that the financial burden would be shared equally between the state, county, and the student body, with each contributing one-third towards the school's operating costs.[6] On August 12, 1953, Westchester County announced that the Institute would be replaced with Westchester Community College beginning September 1, 1953.[7]
