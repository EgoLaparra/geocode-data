It was founded in 1973[1] by eight artists (Martin Bartlett, Mo van Nostrand, Kate Craig, Henry Greenhow, Glenn Lewis, Eric Metcalfe, Michael Morris, Vincent Trasov
[2]) who wanted to create a space for the exploration and creation of new art forms. After they purchased the former Knights of Pythias lodge hall located in Mount Pleasant, Vancouver,[3] it quickly became a centre for poets, dancers, musicians and visual artists interested in exploration and interdisciplinary practices.[4] Many of the Western Front's early works reflect this interdisciplinary ethos with early influences of Duchampian and Fluxus-based investigations into mail art, telecommunications art, live electronic music, video and performance art. Western Front also supported a number of political and activist projects - in one of their most famous performance pieces, founding member Vincent Trasov adopted the personality of Mr. Peanut, gave a number of performances and in 1974 ran for mayor of Vancouver. Mr. Peanut was so highly regarded that he was picked by The Vancouver Sun as one of the province's 100 most influential people as the end of the millennium approached in 1999.[5] As a focal point of experimental art practice through the 1970s and 1980s, the Western Front, in connection with other centres like it, played a major role in the development of electronic and networked art forms in a national and international context.[6][7]

The museum's mission is to preserve the history of the Western Pacific Railroad and is operated by the Feather River Rail Society (reporting mark FRRX),[1] founded in 1983.[2] It is located at a former Western Pacific locomotive facility, adjacent to the Union Pacific's former Western Pacific mainline through the Feather River Canyon.[3]

</p>
      <p id="GL681_052_002" num_links="2">The museum holds in its collection thirty-three Diesel locomotives, one electric locomotive,[citation needed] one steam locomotive[4] (under restoration and on display),[5] eighteen passenger cars (including four from the famous <link wikipedia="California_Zephyr" osm="905830 8440301 8440320" type="relation relation relation">California Zephyr</link> train),[6] numerous freight and maintenance cars[7] and sixteen cabooses.[8] They offer excursions and a "Run A Locomotive" program during the summer.[9] The WPRM has one of the larger collections of early Diesel era locomotives and freight cars in North America. The museum is often considered to have one of the most complete and historic collections of equipment and materials from a single railroad family. The holdings also include extensive corporate records and images, as well as personal collections from those who worked for the Western Pacific. 
The WPRM is a "hands-on" museum that allows visitors to board and explore locomotives and cars in their collection.[3]
Among the significant pieces in the WPRM collection are Western Pacific 805-A, an FP7 model passenger locomotive that pulled the California Zephyr;[10] Southern Pacific EMD GP9 #2873, nicknamed "the Kodachrome" by the volunteers, due to it being painted with the Kodachrome scheme from the failed Santa Fe–Southern Pacific merger; WP 2001, the first GP20 model locomotive (an early turbocharged Diesel);[11] WP 501, an early switch engine and the first Diesel purchased by the Western Pacific;[12] Western Pacific 0-6-0 steam locomotive 165, an oil burning switch engine built by ALCO in 1919;[5] WP 37, a 200-ton rail-mounted crane, two track clearing snowplows (one wedge type and one rotary); and several rare, early 20th century freight cars. Also located at the site are the Portola Diesel Shop, built in 1953, and an interlocking tower from <link wikipedia="Oakland,_California" osm="128110770" type="way">Oakland, California</link>, currently stored unrebuilt. The Western Pacific Hospital, built in 1911 and one of the few remaining railroad hospitals in the country, was part of the museum until it was destroyed in an arson fire on September 7, 2011. The WPRM prides itself on maintaining several of their road Diesels in mainline operating condition and is well known for making occasional movements on Class I railroads using their own historic motive power.

The Macarthur Institute of Higher Education was incorporated in the university in 1989, and in 2001 the University of Western Sydney was restructured as a single multi-campus university rather than as a federation.

It acquired the original 30 acres (120,000 m2) of land.[1] Their goal was to save heritage buildings that were in danger of being destroyed and also to create a hands-on educational facility to teach pioneer life. Glenn Kilmer's father had been a builder and owner of Kilmer Lumber Company in Aylmer Ontario (subsequently sold to Beaver Lumber Co). Golden Macdonnell was a science teacher who had a keen interest in the history of Ontario. Both men were able to reconstruct the donated buildings which arrived at Westfield. Golden built the forges from fieldstone on the site and Doreen managed the General Store. The original name of the facility was the Westfield Pioneer Village.

An access tunnel connects the two platforms and, like Cranford, there are historic photographs of Westfield displayed in the tunnel.

These indentations make roads very circuitous and communications by land difficult. In addition many of the roads are closed by ice and snow for several months of the year.

      <p id="GL681_230_002" num_links="2">The park land is the former estate of George Westinghouse, an <link wikipedia="United_States" osm="424317935 148838" type="node relation">American</link> entrepreneur and engineer, and his wife Marguerite.  With an area of about 10 acres, it was the site of his mansion known as Solitude.  At this house, Westinghouse worked with his engineers, including <link wikipedia="Nikola_Tesla" osm="1764403580 4007814801 5051738293" type="node node node">Nikola Tesla</link>, and entertained notable people of the day, including scientist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), and congressman and later president William McKinley.[1]  Close by was another building, a carriage house, that housed his private laboratory in the basement. There, he developed some of his residential electric lighting technology, installing a generator and running cables to the main house, with wires that were left exposed on the interior walls, so as not to cut into the woodwork.[2]  Also there, Westinghouse invented methods to control and transmit natural gas for both industrial and residential consumers. In the winter of 1883/1884, seeking a source of natural gas in his own "back yard," Westinghouse ordered drilling on his estate.  When gas was struck on May 22, 1884, a blowout resulted in the uncontrolled release of gas for about a week.  Westinghouse devised a way to cap the well.  An illumination test was conducted by igniting the gas jet at the top of a tall pipe.  It initially produced a 100-foot flame that illuminated a mile-wide area to a brightness sufficient to read a newspaper.[2]  This well was designated as "Westinghouse Well No. 1" or "Old No. 1" to distinguish it from several other wells that were drilled in the area.[3]  Eventually, several natural gas derricks towered above the estate's Victorian gardens.[4]   In modern times there is no above-ground trace left of these derricks.

      <p id="GL681_278_002" num_links="2">Westmere as a settled place is of recent origin, though being along the Great Western Turnpike, built in 1799, it was always a place migrants passed through on their way from Albany and <link wikipedia="New_England" osm="9660059" type="relation">New England</link> to the western frontier. A toll gate existed on the turnpike roughly where Highland Estates is located. Even before the turnpike was built, 300 wagons (and sleighs in the winter) passed through in 1796 what would later become Westmere. After World War I development began to encroach on the rural wooded area with mostly bungalows and cottages. This would accelerate in the post-war era after <link wikipedia="World_War_II" osm="6235875594 7783040" type="node relation">World War II</link> and in the 1940s is when the name Westmere would be given to this area.

The promise of fortune and The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged many pioneers from the east to settle in <link wikipedia="Colorado" osm="316945104 161961" type="node relation">Colorado</link> rather than continue on to California.[9] Before the settlements came, wildlife like antelope and buffalo made their homes in the area. There is also evidence of Arapaho Indians near the Crown Point (Gregory Hill) area.[10] Westminsters' first permanent settler was Kentucky farmer Pleasant DeSpain, who built his home in 1870 on 160 acres (near what is now West 76th Avenue and Lowell Street).[11] The area became known as DeSpain Junction and attracted other settlers including Edward Bruce Bowles, who in 1881 constructed a brick Italianate house now known as the Bowles House. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The village of DeSpain Junction grew into a small farming community and continued to attract new settlers despite the difficulty of farming in Colorado's arid climate.[12] Connecticut real estate developer C.J. Harris arrived in DeSpain Junction in 1885 and purchased the DeSpain farm, among others. Harris combined the separate homesteads and divided it into smaller tracts of land, which he sold to fruit farmers. Harris renamed DeSpain Junction with his own and the area was referred to as Harris, Colorado.[13] In 1890, New Yorker Henry T. Mayham convinced the Denver Presbytery to build a university on land that he owned in Harris. After delays caused by the depression of 1893, the school was built from red sandstone quarried in Colorado's <link wikipedia="Red_Rocks_Park" osm="9520443" type="relation">Red Rocks</link> region. The curriculum was patterned after Princeton University and was referred to as the "Princeton of the West". The school was incorporated as Westminster University of Colorado, and classes began in 1908 with one year's tuition costing $50 ($1,411 in 2018).[14] The school ceased operating in 1917, when all students in attendance left to fight in World War I.[15] In the following decade it operated as a church and school. In 1911, Harris voted to incorporate as a city and changed its name to Westminster, in honor of the university which is now on the National Register of Historic Places.

Abbot Leo also expressed the hope that the Priory would become a Community in its own right in the movement of monastic renewal.[2] Today, the community is an Independent or Conventual Priory. 
At the beginning, Abbot Leo considered locating the Priory in Pennsylvania or a few other places, but the presence of other religious houses in those places required that he look elsewhere. With the help of friendly Benedictine Oblates (Dr. Leon and Dorothea Smith) from his time in Keyport, New Jersey, he located a suitable site in the Green Mountains of Vermont.[2]
The original building was an old abandoned farmhouse with an attached barn, a few miles from the village of Weston. The attached barn had been partially burned and was renovated to become the chapel. Abbot Leo engaged Architects and Builders, a Weston group to renovate the barn-chapel. The main house became the monastery kitchen, dining room, library, and tiny gift shop on the ground floor. Four small separate rooms and the Prior's room occupied the second floor.  A dilapidated chicken house  behind the main house was renovated to become classroom, recreation room and dormitory for novices.  This latter building was heated by a small wood stove and fireplace, and had indoor plumbing.[3]

The trail is around 285 km long, and was founded in 1900.  It is currently maintained under the auspices of the Black Forest Club.  The trail symbol is a red lozenge on a white background.
The Westweg is a part of the European Long-distance Trail E1 (<link wikipedia="North_Cape_(Norway)" osm="33728378" type="node">North Cape, Norway</link> - <link wikipedia="Sicily" osm="1781917332 39152" type="node relation">Sicily</link>)
The route passes through or near numerous villages or small towns, so there is no difficulty in finding overnight accommodation and meals along the route.  It would actually require more planning to walk it while staying in <link wikipedia="Hostel" osm="258120524" type="way">youth hostel</link>-type accommodation, or camping.  There are a number of services that will transport your luggage to the next accommodation by vehicle, leaving the hikers with only their daypacks for the hike.  The route can be accessed at several places along its length by road or public transport, so it is easy to walk part of it or to do day walks along its route.
