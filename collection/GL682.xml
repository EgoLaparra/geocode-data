Wetumka is a Muscogee Creek word meaning "tumbling water." [6]  It is the headquarters for two federally recognized tribes, the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town and the Kialegee Tribal Town. It is the home of the Sucker Day, held every year on the last Saturday in September.[6]

The vicinity of the site is also interesting: only two kilometres to the east lie the remains of Rabenswalde Castle; this was the main residence of the lords of Rabenswalde, a branch of the family of the counts of Kevernburg. The castle was besieged and destroyed around 1350 after the Rabenswaldes became robber knights during the Thuringian Counts' War. It is possible that settlements around the castle were also attacked and destroyed at the time the castle was slighted. Only about 1.5 km southeast of Wetzelshain lies another abandoned village that bears the name Lichtehain.

Small portions extend north into the adjacent <link wikipedia="Royalton,_Wisconsin" osm="3643119" type="relation">Town of Royalton</link>. The city is commonly referred to as "Wega" by local residents. The name "Weyauwega" (/waɪ.əˈwiːɡə/ wy-ə-WEE-gə) means "Here we rest" because the town's origin was a stopping/resting point between two rivers when Indians had to portage their canoes. A fur trader built a small building at the location, from which the town later grew.

As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.[5] Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) or above 80 °F (27 °C).[5] During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.[6] Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.[6]

Wheaton laid claim to 640 acres (260 ha) of land in the center of town. Jesse Wheaton later made claim to 300 acres (120 ha) of land just west of Warren's.[7][8] It was not long before other settlers from <link wikipedia="New_England" osm="9660059" type="relation">New England</link> joined them in the community.  In 1848, they gave the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad three miles (5 km) of right-of-way, upon which railroad officials named the depot Wheaton.[6][8] In 1850, ten blocks of land were platted and anyone who was willing to build immediately was granted free land. In 1853, the lots were surveyed and a formal plat for the community was filed with the county. The community was then incorporated as a village on February 24, 1859, with Warren serving as its first President.[9] The village was later incorporated as a city on April 24, 1890, when the first mayor of the city was selected, Judge Elbert Gary, son of Erastus Gary and founder of <link wikipedia="Gary,_Indiana" osm="153543923 127298" type="node relation">Gary, Indiana</link>.[9]

It covers an area of 7.56 km2 (2.92 sq mi) and had a population of 307 in 134 households at the 2001 census.[1]
10 years later it has a population (including Brakefield Green) of 342 according to the 2011 census.[2] For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of <link wikipedia="Breckland_District" osm="1168814" type="relation">Breckland</link>. The civil parish is located south of the nearby town Dereham and is formed from the two ancient parishes which centred round the churches of St Mary's Whinburgh and St Andrew's Westfield, and until 1894 the churches performed all the functions of local government.[3] Norfolk was a county of small villages and parishes. The County of Norfolk Review Order, 1935, sought to rationalise this, and under this Westfield Parish was 'abolished' and merged with Whinburgh Parish. The name of the resultant parish was not changed from Whinburgh.[3] For many years nothing was done about the parish's name, but on 2 August 1995, at the request of the Parish Council, Breckland Council sealed a 'Notice of the Change of Parish Name' and the parish then became Whinburgh and Westfield.[3]

He hosted numerous social events during his stay, inviting well-known guests, including Georges Clemenceau, Robert Cecil, Henry Cabot Lodge and President Warren Harding. 
In 1917, Henry White lent the house to the French mission of Marshal Joseph Joffre to use as its headquarters. While the French flag flew outside of the residence, Marshal Joffre used the house to host high-level strategic meetings. Many important conversations were had at the dining room table, including conversations that led to the establishment of the U.S Department of Health, <link wikipedia="United_States_Department_of_Education" osm="48037721" type="way">Education</link> and Welfare. When Henry White died, the house was passed on to his son John Campbell White. Financier Eugene Meyer rented the home while he was Chairman of the Federal Reserve (1930–1933), after which he bought the bankrupt Washington Post at auction. In 1934, Meyer bought the house from White for $355,000. During their ownership of the home, the Meyers hosted many prominent guests, including Eleanor Roosevelt, <link wikipedia="John_F._Kennedy" osm="2999482598" type="node">John F.

After viewing Harley's initial designs, Sanger urged him to make them more grand. Construction began in 1925 and the cemetery began operation in 1929.[1]  Harley's plan created a long central boulevard flanked by rectangular sections extending from the main gate.  The boulevard ends at a two-story T-shaped mausoleum faced in white marble, set on a white marble base.  Above the central entrance is a square two-story tower which houses a grand hall. Directly behind the hall is one of three chapels in the structure. Crypts are housed in wings extending to the east and west of the grand hall.
