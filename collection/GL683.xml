It was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and its boundaries were increased in 2002 and 2019.[1]  It originally encompassed the central portion of the village's business district, and was then expanded to include a broader array of resources.

      <p id="GL683_110_002" num_links="7">The village of White River Junction is located in central eastern Vermont, at the mouth of the <link wikipedia="White_River_(Vermont)" osm="2142465" type="relation">White River</link> where it joins the <link wikipedia="Connecticut_River" osm="1984261" type="relation">Connecticut River</link>.  First settled in the 1760s, it was from the 1840s to the 1960s the most important railroad junction in northern New England, providing an interchange point between the Boston and Maine Railroad (originally known as the Connecticut River Railroad), the Vermont Central Railway, which served <link wikipedia="Burlington,_Vermont" osm="158855993 199071" type="node relation">Burlington</link>, the Passumpsic Rivers Railroad, which served <link wikipedia="Newport_(city),_Vermont" osm="622769607 199080" type="node relation">Newport</link>, the Northern New Hampshire Railroad, serving <link wikipedia="Concord,_New_Hampshire" osm="60169822 170182" type="node relation">Concord, New Hampshire</link> and <link wikipedia="Boston" osm="158809705 2315704" type="node relation">Boston, Massachusetts</link>, and the Woodstock Railway, serving <link wikipedia="Woodstock,_Vermont" osm="2030466" type="relation">Woodstock, Vermont</link>.  Its central business district is located southwest of a bend in the Vermont Central tracks, which roughly parallel the White River as it enters the Connecticut.  Over the period of its economic height, the business area grew, mainly to the west and south, with residential areas in the surrounding uplands and across the White River.  The village's economy declined after railroad service was reduced in the mid-20th century.[2]

The town was once significantly larger and home to industrial activity such as pottery and brick-making, and coal and sand mining took place nearby.

Passenger services ceased on 13 March 1949, and due to declining freight, the line was closed entirely on 31 March 1962.  The railway's engine shed still stands in the town.

There are multiple versions of how the town was named.[1][2]  It may be named after Richard Whitford, a man who operated a flax mill on the  Waikopua near Housons Creek[1] and was the postman.[2] Others think Whitford referred to the White-ford over the Turanga Creek at the end of Sandstone Road, where the salt dries when the tide is out.[1][2]  Another possibility is that it is named after Whitefoord Park part of a  vast property belonging to L.D. Nathan was initially listed as ‘Whitefoord Park’ in Wises Post Office Directory for 1875-6, but by the time it went on sale for subdivision in 1903 it was known as Whitford Park.[2]
