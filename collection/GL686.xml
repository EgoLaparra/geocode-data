It is a three-story, "T" shaped, steel frame and reinforced concrete structure above a raised basement.  It is faced in stucco and decorative half-timber framing in the Tudor Revival style. It features asymmetrical massing, a four-story polygonal tower with a hexagonal roof, and three story pavilions with recessed sleeping porches.  It was named in honor of entertainer Will Rogers (1879-1935) in 1936 and provided unconventional tubercular treatment to entertainment industry patients from 1930 to 1974.  It also was open as a night club but when casinos were voted down in New York, it was closed.  Then it was open as an apartment house.  It stood abandoned for years slowly deteriorating.  It was briefly used as press headquarters for the 1980 Winter Olympics.[2] Finally it was bought and after a huge renovation was done both to the outside and inside, it currently houses an independent living facility known as Saranac Village at Will Rogers.

The log home was built in the early 19th century by her great-grandfather and has been enlarged twice.  The building was previously the home of Rachel E. Boak, Cather's grandmother.  Cather and her parents lived in the house only about a year before they moved to another home in Frederick County.  The farmhouse was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register (VLR) in 1976 and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1978.

</p>
      <p id="GL686_253_002" num_links="2">The house was originally owned by Cather's great-grandfather, Jacob Seibert.  The original portion of the home was probably built in the 1810s.  A two-story frame extension on the western end of the house was added around twenty years later while an ell was probably added sometime after the Civil War.  In 1869, the home and 4.5 acres (1.8 ha) of land was conveyed to Seibert's daughter, Rachel E. Boak.  Virginia Boak, her daughter, and Charles Cather were married at the house in December 1872.  The following year on December 7, the couple's first child, Willa Cather, was born in the house.  In 1874, Willa and her parents moved to a nearby home, Willow Shade, also listed on the NRHP.  Cather's relatives began moving to <link wikipedia="Nebraska" osm="316971452 161648" type="node relation">Nebraska</link> in the 1870s and her family followed in 1883, settling in <link wikipedia="Red_Cloud,_Nebraska" osm="151703786 169385" type="node relation">Red Cloud</link>.  The house where she was born was conveyed from Cather's grandmother to a woman named S.S. Gore.  Ownership of the home changed hands four more times until being purchased by Charles T. Brill in 1950.  At the time of the home's historical survey taken in 1976, Brill used the building as an office and retreat.[3]

It is part of the dePierrefeu Wildlife Sanctuary, which is owned by the New Hampshire Audubon Society.[2] Because the pond and the land around it are part of the sanctuary, the shore is unable to be developed. Therefore, there are no buildings around the pond and there won't be in the foreseeable future. Willard is instead surrounded by extensive amounts of wilderness and hiking trails that lead around the pond and to the summits of Bald Mountain and Goodhue Hill. Willard is a popular fishing, boating and hiking  destination, and it has become more popular with its mention in numerous magazines and newspapers.

His significance in relation to the school came about after his militant service. He continued to help nurse the ailing and was an active participant in the matters concerning both Roanoke City and Virginia. Then he served in the General Assembly as the senator of Virginia and also as the governor for an abrupt period.

Father "Mac" as he was affectionately known in Paterson was so revered by its Irish and German Roman Catholic communities that his mere admonishing appearance in midst of Passaic County's 1880 Garret Rock May Day Riot or what national newspaper coverage of the time called "the most serious riot that has ever occurred in that section of the country" was sufficient to permit police to thereafter act to end the rioting. During his lifetime, the Pope, anyway, accorded this truly Reverend Father the extraordinary honor of naming him to the office of Papal chamberlain, which office is normally the reserve of European nobility. Father McNulty lies in front of Paterson's St. John's Church under an honoring bronze monument of his counseling a parish youth.

Tanner was a land surveyor who noted the commercial potential of the Aurora area. He purchased a large tract of land on the west side of the river and invited his family, still in New York, to move in with him. For the next four years, Tanner harvested the land, until he briefly moved back to New York in 1839 to marry Anna Plum Makepeace. They moved back to Aurora the following year, working the farm until 1853. Together they had ten children; with this large family, Tanner required a larger house. After a few years living downtown, they moved to this house. Tanner now worked as a hardware businessman; his hardware firm stayed in business until 1979 and was the longest-running business in town.[1]

The executors invited five architecture firms to participate in a competition to determine the fountain's design, and to provide designs for a "good architectural treatment of the whole plaza."[6] In January 1913, the five schemes were exhibited at the New York Public Library, including the winning scheme, designed by <link wikipedia="Carrère_and_Hastings" osm="357620584" type="node">Carrère and Hastings</link>. Architect Thomas Hasting's design placed the fountain in the southern half of the plaza, whereas the Sherman Monument remained in the northern half (but moved fifteen feet west to be symmetrically opposite the fountain). Construction of the new plaza began in 1915, and by November one newspaper reported: "The Pulitzer Fountain...is now finished and bubbling with the purest Croton water," noting that work on the northern portion of the plaza was delayed by subway construction.[7]
