Residents and vacationers enjoy yearly events such as the Labor Day Boat Parade and Paddle Williamstown, among other summer festivities. 

There are two main public boat ramps available- The Williamstown Marina and Ruby's Boat Dock. Both offer fuel and small convenience stores, and The Williamstown Marina also delivers pizza and subs to docks.

Major issues surrounding Williamstown Lake include the Williamstown Lake Expansion Project and the nearby development of the Ark Encounter attraction.

Luther Wright, its principal from 1841 to 1849, believed it was desirable to have his pupils study together in a single room under his direction. However, the school's student population grew rapidly and the one-room schoolhouse scheme was soon no longer practicable, as more instructors and new buildings were added. By the 1850s the schools campus was dominated by three large buildings: North Hall, Middle Hall and South Hall. For many years the school was co-educational, with the students divided and taught separately in male and female departments, but in 1864 the female division was discontinued.[5][6]

The community is located in the Arkansas Delta and is surrounded by fertile cropland historically used to produce cotton. Wilson started as a company town in 1886 by Robert E. Lee Wilson, who would build a cotton empire and run it from the city. The Wilson Company would become so successful that all of the town's buildings were rebuilt in Tudor Revival architectural style following Wilson's son's honeymoon to <link wikipedia="England" osm="58447" type="relation">England</link> in 1925. Wilson did not incorporate until 1959.  Lee Wilson and Company remained in the Wilson family until 2010.[3] The community has seen a rapid decline in economic activity and population since the advent of mechanization on the farm, reducing the need for manual labor to produce cotton. The population was 903 at the 2010 census.  The town is incorporated and does not have an owner.

While there have been no requests since 1978, the Code of Federal Regulations last amended in 1999 requires 24-hour notice to be opened.[2][6]
The bridge has been minimally altered since its construction and is eligible for individual listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).[4]

      <p id="GL687_354_002" num_links="2">The bridge is located at a crossing established by the pre-colonial Hackensack tribe.  As its name suggests, Liitle Ferry had been the site of a ferry crossing since the colonial era, with a rope-towed boat operating between 1659 and 1826.[7] The first bridge was built in 1812.[4] The Bergen Turnpike was an important road between nearby <link wikipedia="Hackensack,_New_Jersey" osm="158804728 170624" type="node relation">Hackensack</link> and the Hudson Waterfront at <link wikipedia="Hoboken,_New_Jersey" osm="158846013 170708" type="node relation">Hoboken</link>.[8] Ferry service was augmented with rail service in the early 1890s by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYSW),[9] the tracks of which pass under the S46.[1] Soon after the predecessor to the Public Service began trolley service.[8] A vehicular crossing was created in 1934 with the construction of the road that would become Route 46.[10] The bridge was constructed as part of the expansion of the state highway system in the 1920s and 1930 to carry State Highway Route 6.[4][11][12] At its western end, the Little Ferry Circle was built in 1933 in conjunction with bridge.

The building was a gift to the university from Board of Trustees member and Bayonne businessman, Garrett E. Winants, and cost $75,000. The construction of the dormitory satisfied many long-awaited needs of the college. The new residential system also fostered a thriving social atmosphere for students, staff, and guests as it served as a student dormitory from 1890 to 1947.

The cave is notable for its calcite formations known as boxwork, as well as its frostwork. Approximately 95 percent of the world's discovered boxwork formations are found in Wind Cave. The cave is recognized as the densest cave system in the world, with the greatest passage volume per cubic mile. Wind Cave is one of the longest caves in the world with 149.01 miles (239.81 km) of explored cave passageways, as of 2018[update].[3] Above ground, the park includes the largest remaining natural mixed-grass prairie in the United States.

The Berwind-White Coal Mining Company imported workers from eastern and southern Europe and exploited ethnic divisions in the area (which had been settled by Germans and Irish in the 19th century). On Good Friday 1922, coal miners walked out of the mines in Windber and several nearby locations in Somerset County, attempting to force the mine owners to recognize their United Mine Workers union, as well as accurately weigh the coal they mined. The company employed legal tactics (the United States Supreme Court decided two lawsuits) as well as strike-breakers, but the miners received considerable favorable national publicity and local support and held out until the end of the following summer.[3] However, the UMW successfully organized the mines during 1933, after the Great Depression led to the election of President <link wikipedia="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" osm="1610589818" type="node">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</link>.
