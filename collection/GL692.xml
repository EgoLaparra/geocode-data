It never served this purpose, and was in disrepair by 1986. Congress approved the WIMSA memorial in 1985, and the Hemicycle approved as the site for the memorial in 1988. An open design competition was won by <link wikipedia="New_York_City" osm="61785451 575213527 175905" type="node way relation">New York City</link> architects Marion Weiss and Michael Manfredi.

The latter is reached by following the steep, paved walkway that leads from the picnic area to the summit. The vicinity of the fort ruins also afford sweeping views of the city, whose council declared the area around the Wonderboom and both banks of the Apies River a reserve on 28 December 1949.

In 2005, the Loudoun County School Board approved the use of Fields Farm, a property north of the Town of Purcellville on County land, but in an urban growth zone jointly controlled by the Town and the County, known as PUGAMP.  The town of Purcellville was not pleased with the decision, because of traffic concerns and also because it was expected to provide essential services to the new high school, despite being located outside of the Town.  The School Board claimed that the high school's best location was in Fields Farm, and on June 20, 2006, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors voted 6-3 to start construction of Woodgrove on Fields Farm.  The Town of Purcellville pursued legal action in court to stop its construction with a <link wikipedia="Richmond,_Virginia" osm="2592301390 3864712" type="node relation">Richmond</link> legal firm; the case is still pending in Court.

      <p id="GL692_421_001" num_links="5">Woodstock Express was designed by John C. Allen of the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC). It is based on the first three roller coasters he designed shortly after becoming the company's president in 1954. These coasters opened in 1956 at <link wikipedia="Hunt's_Pier" osm="230920883" type="way">Hunt's Pier</link>, Angela Park and the Gooding Zoo (now the <link wikipedia="Columbus_Zoo_and_Aquarium" osm="30430453" type="way">Columbus Zoo and Aquarium</link>).[1]  Allen modified the original design, making Woodstock Express a little taller and longer.  He eliminated the curved loading station as well, opting instead for an in-line station that precedes the curve to the lift hill.  This modified design was then used to build two nearly identical models at <link wikipedia="Kings_Dominion" osm="2624268097 38157094" type="node way">Kings Dominion</link> and <link wikipedia="Carowinds" osm="669969052" type="way">Carowinds</link>.[1] A third copy at <link wikipedia="Canada's_Wonderland" osm="333030807" type="way">Canada's Wonderland</link> was also based on this design but is taller and slightly longer, and it was designed by Curtis D.

The Woodstock collection began as an assemblage of children's books and was housed within a public school. In 1911, the station was replaced by a "sub-branch" library offering more books for adults and children, but without the reference works and services available at regular branches. The collection moved into a larger facility in 1914, which became a full branch in 1917, offering additional resources and services.

The Woodstock School underwent expansions in 1925 and 1955, but a fire in 1980 destroyed the building's two-story center. Protests by Woodstock residents and the Woodstock Parent Teachers Association ended the school district's plans to close the school due to fire damage and low student enrollment throughout the city. The school remained open and underwent repairs, but its second story was lost. The school marks the oldest standing elementary school in Portland.[3]
