From the diary of Binyomin Wilhelm (as cited by his great-grandson, Rabbi Zvi Belsky), Louis Dershowitz is credited, not only with giving early financial and moral support for the founding of the yeshiva,  but for the very idea of establishing a yeshiva in Williamsburg. The two friends contacted prominent local Rabbi Zev Gold of Congregation Beth Jacob Anshe Sholom [1][2] and together they formed a board and established the Yeshiva on Keap Street in Williamsburg as an elementary school. The Yeshiva later moved to a new building at 206 Wilson Street and remained there until 1967, (The elementary school remained at 206 Wilson St. Until 1974) when it moved to its current location at 452 and 425 East 9th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11218. Rabbi Gold was elected as the Yeshiva's first president and suggested the name of the school (which in its English rendering is, Yeshiva Torah Vodaath), after the yeshiva founded in <link wikipedia="Lida" osm="242978903 400507" type="node relation">Lida</link> in 1905 by Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines, which combined secular studies with Jewish studies and traditional Talmud study.[3] During this first period in the yeshiva's history,  the yeshiva was modeled after those in Europe, with religious studies in Yiddish and Talmud taught in the Hungarian style of the European yeshivas.[4]

A detailed study of Bugunta mineral waters (the original name of the waters, after the Bugunta River flowing nearby) was made in 1823 by the Russian doctor and pharmacologist A. P. Nelyubin, who found twenty more mineral springs on the slopes of the mountain he referred to as Shchelochnaya (Nelyubin's numbering of the Yessentuki mineral waters is still maintained). In 1825, General Yermolov founded the stanitsa of Yessentukskaya on the Bugunta River 3.5 kilometers (2.2 mi) northeast of the former Yessentuksky post;[citation needed] its inhabitants were engaged in trade, trucking, and serving arriving patients. In 1839, water from springs ##23-26 was led to the common pool, where the first two baths of the wooden bathhouse were built at the expense of the Cossack Regiment Management.

Since ancient times, it was a key point between <link wikipedia="Luoyang" osm="244081266 3246491" type="node relation">Luoyang</link> and Changan. It has great strategic importance, being often a battlefield or a place for merchants to trade. Yima was founded two years before the Qin Dynasty established the new county system (it took 81 years to build the city). After the People's Republic of China was found, Yima reached county-level status in Henan Province in 1981. It was originally under the administration of <link wikipedia="Luoyang" osm="244081266 3246491" type="node relation">Luoyang</link>. However, since 1986, it has been under the administration of Sanmenxia. Currently, it is one of the forty-eight counties in Henan Province trying to expand. It is also one of China's top hundred counties, as well as the smallest city in China (112 square kilometers with a population of about 160,000). Yima has the advantage of being self-sustaining, allowing for massive redevelopment of its industry and increased economic growth. In 2010, the city's per capita GDP was over seventy thousand RMB, which is about ten thousand US dollars. It ranks alongside moderately developed countries. In 2010, it was ranked first economically in Henan Province (perennial top five). The city is also known as a "The Home of Martial Arts".

The inspiration for the stations form came from the stations in the historical Jezreel Valley railway and also from the many agricultural structures that can be seen in the area with a similar design, a rectangular structure with a 2 sided roof.
In addition to the station, there is also a water tower, inspired from the water towers that the historical line used. The original water towers were used for refilling the steam locomotives, but the modern tower was added to ensure constant water pressure in the station itself. The tracks are on ground level, but the access to the platforms requires the use of an underpass.

During the Islamic movement led by Shehu Usman Dan Fodio in the early 19th Century, Modibbo Adama was recognised as a learned Muslim who could lead the people in the Upper Benue area. Modibbo is the Fulani word for "Professor". Probably the first European to visit the area was Heinrich Barth in 1851, shortly after Yola was founded.

Funding from Andrew Carnegie was sought for after his recent funding for Woodland Public Library in neighboring <link wikipedia="Woodland,_California" osm="2584100971 112607" type="node relation">Woodland, California</link>. One of Carnegie's employees, James Beltram, felt that the county had received their allotment of Carnegie mony, but the county librarian still sought the funding. The Yolo County librarian corresponded with James Beltram for roughly 20 letters when $3,000 was finally offered to construct a new branch in 1917. Once Beltram realized the county's intent of putting the branch in Yolo, he objected to the funding again, this time on the basis that the community was too close to the formerly funded library. Yolo was defended with the fact that its current facilities were out of date and that it served a large rural base.[3]

Raimundo Yorba built the adobe on land thought to be part of Rancho El Rincon, a land grant owned by his father, Bernardo Yorba; however, a later survey determined the adobe was not part of the rancho. The younger Yorba lived in the adobe until 1868, when Forty-Niner and Mexican–American War veteran Fenton M. Slaughter bought the house. Slaughter, who later served in the California State Assembly, lived in the house until his 1897 death.[3]
